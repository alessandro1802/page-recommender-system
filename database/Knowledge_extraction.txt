knowledge extraction creation knowledge structured relational database xml unstructured text document image source the resulting knowledge need machine-readable machine-interpretable format must represent knowledge manner facilitates inferencing although methodically similar information extraction nlp etl data warehouse main criterion extraction result go beyond creation structured information transformation relational schema requires either reuse existing formal knowledge reusing identifier ontology generation schema based source data the group currently standardizing language extraction resource description framework rdf relational database another popular example knowledge extraction transformation wikipedia structured data also mapping existing knowledge see dbpedia freebase after standardization knowledge representation language rdf owl much research conducted area especially regarding transforming relational database rdf identity resolution knowledge discovery ontology learning the general process us traditional method information extraction extract transform load etl transform data source structured format the following criterion used categorize approach topic account extraction relational database president obama called wednesday congress extend tax break student included last year economic stimulus package arguing policy provides generous assistance when building rdb representation problem domain starting point frequently entity-relationship diagram erd typically entity represented database table attribute entity becomes column table relationship entity indicated foreign key each table typically defines particular class entity column one attribute each row table describes entity instance uniquely identified primary key the table row collectively describe entity set equivalent rdf representation entity set render equivalent view based rdf semantics basic mapping algorithm would follows early mentioning basic direct mapping found tim berners-lee comparison model rdf model the mapping mentioned expose legacy data rdf straightforward way additional refinement employed improve usefulness rdf output respective given use case normally information lost transformation entity-relationship diagram erd relational table detail found object-relational impedance mismatch reverse engineered from conceptual view approach extraction come two direction the first direction try extract learn owl schema given database schema early approach used fixed amount manually created mapping rule refine mapping more elaborate method employing heuristic learning algorithm induce schematic information method overlap ontology learning while approach try extract information structure inherent sql schema analysing e.g foreign key others analyse content value table create conceptual hierarchy e.g column value candidate becoming category the second direction try map schema content pre-existing domain ontology see also ontology alignment often however suitable domain ontology exist created first xml structured tree data easily represented rdf structured graph one example approach us rdf blank node transforms xml element attribute rdf property the topic however complex case relational database relational table primary key ideal candidate becoming subject extracted triple xml element however transformed depending context- subject predicate object triple xslt used standard transformation language manually convert xml rdf the largest portion information contained business document encoded natural language therefore unstructured because unstructured data rather challenge knowledge extraction sophisticated method required generally tend supply worse result compared structured data the potential massive acquisition extracted knowledge however compensate increased complexity decreased quality extraction following natural language source understood source information data given unstructured fashion plain text given text additionally embedded markup document html document mentioned system normally remove markup element automatically preprocessing step knowledge extraction necessary perform linguistic annotation one multiple nlp tool individual module nlp workflow normally build tool-specific format input output context knowledge extraction structured format representing linguistic annotation applied typical nlp task relevant knowledge extraction include nlp data typically represented tsv format csv format tab separator often referred conll format for knowledge extraction workflow rdf view data created accordance following community standard other platform-specific format include traditional information extraction technology natural language processing extract information typically natural language text structure suitable manner the kind information identified must specified model beginning process whole process traditional information extraction domain dependent the split following five subtasks the task named entity recognition recognize categorize named entity contained text assignment named entity predefined category this work application grammar based method statistical model coreference resolution identifies equivalent entity recognized ner within text there two relevant kind equivalence relationship the first one relates relationship two different represented entity e.g ibm europe ibm second one relationship entity anaphoric reference e.g ibm both kind recognized coreference resolution during template element construction system identifies descriptive property entity recognized ner these property correspond ordinary quality like red big template relation construction identifies relation exist template element these relation several kind works-for located-in restriction domain range correspond entity template scenario production event described text identified structured respect entity recognized ner relation identified ontology-based information extraction subfield information extraction least one ontology used guide process information extraction natural language text the obie system us method traditional information extraction identify concept instance relation used ontology text structured ontology process thus input ontology constitute model information extracted ontology learning automatic semi-automatic creation ontology including extracting corresponding domain term natural language text building ontology manually extremely labor-intensive time consuming great motivation automate process during semantic annotation natural language text augmented metadata often represented rdfa make semantics contained term machine-understandable process generally semi-automatic knowledge extracted sense link lexical term example concept ontology established thus knowledge gained meaning term processed context intended therefore meaning text grounded machine-readable data ability draw inference semantic annotation typically split following two subtasks terminology extraction level lexical term text extracted for purpose tokenizer determines first word boundary solves abbreviation afterwards term text correspond concept extracted help domain-specific lexicon link entity linking entity linking link extracted lexical term source text concept ontology knowledge base dbpedia established for candidate-concepts detected appropriately several meaning term help lexicon finally context term analyzed determine appropriate disambiguation assign term correct concept note semantic annotation context knowledge extraction confused semantic parsing understood natural language processing also referred semantic annotation semantic parsing aim complete machine-readable representation natural language whereas semantic annotation sense knowledge extraction tackle elementary aspect the following criterion used categorize tool extract knowledge natural language text the following table characterizes tool knowledge extraction natural language source knowledge discovery describes process automatically searching large volume data pattern considered knowledge data often described deriving knowledge input data knowledge discovery developed data mining domain closely related term methodology terminology the well-known branch data mining knowledge discovery also known knowledge discovery database kdd just many form knowledge discovery creates abstraction input data the knowledge obtained process may become additional data used usage discovery often outcome knowledge discovery actionable actionable knowledge discovery also known domain driven data mining aim discover deliver actionable knowledge insight another promising application knowledge discovery area software modernization weakness discovery compliance involves understanding existing software artifact this process related concept reverse engineering usually knowledge obtained existing software presented form model specific query made necessary entity relationship frequent format representing knowledge obtained existing software object management group omg developed specification knowledge discovery metamodel kdm defines
