A History of Political Theory is a book by George Holland Sabine on the history of political thought from Ancient Greece to fascism and Nazism in the 1930s. First published in 1937,[1] it propounds a hypothesis that theories of politics are themselves a part of politics.[2] That is, they do not refer to an external reality but are produced as a normal part of the social milieu in which politics itself has its being. The book has been translated into Arabic, Greek, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish.[3] In 1973, Dryden Press issued a fourth edition, revised by Thomas Landon Thorson.

Floyd House noted "adequate scholarship, his interpretations are highly intelligent, and he has covered the ground with surprising comprehensiveness."[4] James Leahigh wrote that it was "as objective and unbiased a study of the many characters presented throughout his work as any hitherto attempted compendious history of political theory."[5] Leland Jenks chose to review it with ten other works on political theory and noted, "Half of Sabine's material is devoted to men before Bodin, and his treatment of the nineteenth century while brilliant is relatively brief."[6] Jenks considers the natural audience for it to be "best for students who are to apprehend the importance of political speculation in the history of social thought." Jenks admired Sabine's composition: "Sabine is most successful in integrating theories of successive writers as coherent wholes, and in discerning logical discrepancies. He provides an original and searching critique, from the explicit standpoint of Humean empiricism." The role of value systems in politics is acknowledged: "Sabine is especially effective in showing the relativity of social thought to general value systems in different societies." When the book was revised in 1950, Journal of Philosophy reviewer C. F. noted the new edition "more strongly emphasizes the wide separation between the moral temper of democracy and that of communism."[7] Thomas Landon Thorson, author of Logic of Democracy (1962) and Biopolitics (1970), revised A History of Political Theory in 1973 for a fourth edition. He explains the revisions in a preface: The new first chapter refers to cultural evolution: To maintain such an anthropological scope, Thorson sketches the dominant cultures before the arrival of democracy in Greece. He concedes a Middle Eastern dominance. Thorson then quotes William Hardy McNeill: Thorson describes the global situation then:
