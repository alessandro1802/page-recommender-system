telerobotics area robotics concerned control semi-autonomous robot distance chiefly using television wireless network like wi-fi bluetooth deep space network tethered connection combination two major subfields teleoperation telepresence teleoperation indicates operation machine distance similar meaning phrase remote control usually encountered research academic technical environment commonly associated robotics mobile robot applied whole range circumstance device machine operated person distance teleoperation standard term used research technical community referring operation distance this opposed telepresence refers subset telerobotic system configured immersive interface operator feel present remote environment projecting presence remote robot one first telepresence system enabled operator feel present remote environment primary sens sight sound touch virtual fixture system developed air force research laboratory early the system enabled operator perform dexterous task inserting peg hole remotely operator would feel inserting peg fact robot remotely performing task telemanipulator teleoperator device controlled remotely human operator simple case controlling operator command action correspond directly action device controlled example radio-controlled model aircraft tethered deep submergence vehicle where communication delay make direct control impractical remote planetary rover desired reduce operator workload remotely controlled spy attack aircraft device controlled directly instead commanded follow specified path increasing level sophistication device may operate somewhat independently matter obstacle avoidance also commonly employed planetary rover device designed allow operator control robot distance sometimes called telecheric robotics two major component telerobotics telepresence visual control application remote camera provides visual representation view robot placing robotic camera perspective allows intuitive control recent technique although based science fiction robert heinlein waldo fruitful speed resolution bandwidth recently adequate task able control robot camera meaningful way using head mounted display control camera facilitated tracking head shown figure this work user feel comfortable latency system lag response movement visual representation any issue inadequate resolution latency video image lag mechanical computer processing movement response optical distortion due camera lens head mounted display lens cause user 'simulator sickness exacerbated lack vestibular stimulation visual representation motion mismatch user motion registration error lag movement response due overfiltering inadequate resolution small movement slow speed contribute problem the technology control robot eyeâ€“hand coordination issue become even pervasive system user tension frustration make system difficult use citation needed the tendency build robot minimize degree freedom reduces control problem recent improvement computer shifted emphasis degree freedom allowing robotic device seem intelligent human motion this also allows direct teleoperation user control robot motion telerobotic interface simple common mmk monitor-mouse-keyboard interface while immersive inexpensive telerobotics driven internet connection often type valuable modification mmk joystick provides intuitive navigation scheme planar robot movement dedicated telepresence setup utilize head-mounted display either single dual eye display ergonomically matched interface joystick related button slider trigger control other interface merge fully immersive virtual reality interface real-time video instead computer-generated image another example would use omnidirectional treadmill immersive display system robot driven person walking running additional modification may include merged data display infrared thermal imaging real-time threat assessment device schematic citation needed with exception apollo

time lightspeed time delay human operator ground robotic planetary exploration program use spacecraft programmed human ground station essentially achieving long-time-delay form telerobotic operation recent noteworthy example include mar exploration rover mer curiosity rover case mer mission spacecraft rover operated stored program rover driver ground programming day operation the international
