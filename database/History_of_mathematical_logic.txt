mathematical logic study formal logic within mathematics major subareas include model theory proof theory set theory recursion theory research mathematical logic commonly address mathematical property formal system logic expressive deductive power however also include us logic characterize correct mathematical reasoning establish foundation mathematics since inception mathematical logic contributed motivated study foundation mathematics this study began late century development axiomatic framework geometry arithmetic analysis early century shaped david hilbert program prove consistency foundational theory result kurt gödel gerhard gentzen others provided partial resolution program clarified issue involved proving consistency work set theory showed almost ordinary mathematics formalized term set although theorem proven common axiom system set theory contemporary work foundation mathematics often focus establishing part mathematics formalized particular formal system reverse mathematics rather trying find theory mathematics developed the handbook mathematical logic make rough division contemporary mathematical logic four area additionally sometimes field computational complexity theory also included part mathematical logic each area distinct focus although many technique result shared among multiple area the borderline amongst field line separating mathematical logic field mathematics always sharp gödel incompleteness theorem mark milestone recursion theory proof theory also led löb theorem modal logic the method forcing employed set theory model theory recursion theory well study intuitionistic mathematics the mathematical field category theory us many formal axiomatic method includes study categorical logic category theory ordinarily considered subfield mathematical logic because applicability diverse field mathematics mathematician including saunders mac lane proposed category theory foundational system mathematics independent

tradition formal philosophical logic mathematics mathematical logic also called 'logistic 'symbolic logic 'algebra logic recently simply 'formal logic set logical theory elaborated course last nineteenth century aid artificial notation rigorously deductive method before emergence logic studied rhetoric calculationes syllogism philosophy the first half century saw explosion fundamental result accompanied vigorous debate foundation mathematics theory logic developed many culture history including china india greece islamic world greek method particularly aristotelian logic term logic found organon found wide application acceptance western science mathematics millennium the stoic especially chrysippus began development predicate logic europe attempt treat operation formal logic symbolic algebraic way made philosophical mathematician including leibniz lambert labor remained isolated little known middle nineteenth century george boole augustus morgan presented systematic mathematical treatment logic their work building work algebraist george peacock extended traditional aristotelian doctrine logic sufficient framework study foundation mathematics charles sander peirce later built upon work boole develop logical system relation quantifier published several paper gottlob frege presented independent development logic quantifier begriffsschrift published work generally considered marking turning point history logic frege work remained obscure however bertrand russell began promote near turn century the two-dimensional notation frege developed never widely adopted unused contemporary text from ernst schröder published vorlesungen über die algebra der logik three volume this work summarized extended work boole morgan peirce comprehensive reference symbolic logic understood end century concern mathematics built proper foundation led development axiomatic system fundamental area mathematics arithmetic analysis geometry logic term arithmetic refers theory

richard dedekind showed natural number uniquely characterized induction property dedekind proposed different characterization lacked formal logical character peano axiom dedekind work however proved

contains least two point circle radius whose center separated radius must intersect hilbert developed complete set axiom geometry building previous work pasch the success axiomatizing geometry motivated hilbert seek complete axiomatizations area mathematics natural number real line this would prove major area research first half century the century saw great advance theory real analysis including theory convergence function fourier series mathematician karl weierstrass began construct function stretched intuition nowhere-differentiable continuous function previous conception function rule computation smooth graph longer adequate weierstrass began advocate arithmetization analysis sought axiomatize analysis using property natural number the modern -definition limit continuous

theorem set cardinality powerset cantor believed every set could well-ordered unable produce proof result leaving open problem early decade century main area study set theory formal logic the discovery paradox informal set theory caused wonder whether mathematics inconsistent look proof consistency hilbert posed famous list problem next century the first two resolve continuum hypothesis

mathematical logic effort resolve hilbert entscheidungsproblem posed this problem asked procedure would decide given formalized mathematical statement whether statement true false ernst zermelo gave proof every set could well-ordered result georg cantor unable obtain achieve proof zermelo introduced axiom choice drew heated debate research among mathematician pioneer set theory the immediate criticism method led zermelo publish second exposition result directly addressing criticism proof this paper led general acceptance axiom choice mathematics community skepticism axiom choice reinforced recently discovered paradox naive set theory cesare burali-forti first state paradox burali-forti paradox show collection ordinal number form set very soon thereafter bertrand russell discovered russell paradox jules richard discovered richard paradox full citation needed zermelo provided first set axiom set theory these axiom together additional axiom replacement proposed abraham fraenkel called zermelo–fraenkel set theory zermelo axiom incorporated principle limitation size avoid russell paradox first volume principia mathematica russell alfred north whitehead published this seminal work developed theory function cardinality completely formal framework type theory russell whitehead developed effort avoid paradox principia mathematica considered one influential work century although framework type theory prove popular foundational theory mathematics fraenkel proved axiom choice proved axiom zermelo set theory urelements later work paul cohen showed addition urelements needed axiom choice unprovable cohen proof developed method forcing important tool establishing independence result set theory leopold löwenheim thoralf skolem obtained löwenheim–skolem

gödel incompleteness theorem establish additional limit first-order axiomatizations the first incompleteness theorem state consistent effectively given defined logical system capable interpreting arithmetic exists statement true sense hold natural number provable within logical system indeed may fail non-standard model arithmetic may consistent logical system for example every logical system capable expressing peano axiom gödel sentence hold natural number proved here logical system said effectively given possible decide given formula language system whether formula axiom one express peano axiom called sufficiently strong when applied first-order logic first incompleteness theorem implies sufficiently strong consistent effective first-order theory model elementarily equivalent stronger limitation one established löwenheim–skolem theorem the second incompleteness theorem state sufficiently strong consistent effective axiom system arithmetic prove consistency interpreted show hilbert program reached many logic besides first-order logic studied these include infinitary logic allow formula provide infinite amount information higher-order logic include portion set theory

example frege logic similar set-theoretic aspect although higher-order logic expressive allowing complete axiomatizations structure natural number satisfy analogue completeness compactness theorem first-order logic thus le amenable proof-theoretic analysis another type logic fixed-point logic allow inductive definition like one writes primitive recursive function one formally define extension first-order logic notion encompasses logic section behave like first-order logic certain fundamental way encompass logic general e.g encompass intuitionistic modal fuzzy logic lindström theorem
