lemmatisation lemmatization linguistics process grouping together inflected form word analysed single item identified word lemma dictionary form computational linguistics lemmatisation algorithmic process determining lemma word based intended meaning unlike stemming lemmatisation depends correctly identifying intended part speech meaning word sentence well within larger context surrounding sentence neighboring sentence even entire document result developing efficient lemmatisation algorithm open area research many language word appear several inflected form for example english verb 'to walk may appear 'walk 'walked 'walks 'walking the base form 'walk one might look dictionary called lemma word the association base form part speech often called lexeme word lemmatisation closely related stemming the difference stemmer operates single word without knowledge context therefore discriminate word different meaning depending part speech however stemmer typically easier implement run faster the reduced accuracy may matter application fact used within information retrieval system stemming improves query recall accuracy true positive rate compared lemmatisation nonetheless stemming reduces precision proportion positively-labeled instance actually positive system for instance document indexing software like lucene store base stemmed format word without knowledge meaning considering word formation grammar rule the stemmed word might valid word 'lazy seen example stemmed many stemmer 'lazi this purpose stemming produce appropriate lemma challenging task requires knowledge context the main purpose stemming map different form word single form rule-based algorithm dependent upon spelling word sacrifice accuracy ensure example 'laziness stemmed 'lazi stem 'lazy trivial way lemmatization simple dictionary lookup this work well straightforward inflected form rule-based system needed case language long compound word such rule either hand-crafted learned automatically annotated corpus morphological analysis published biomedical literature yield useful result morphological processing biomedical text effective specialised lemmatisation program biomedicine may improve accuracy practical information extraction task
