photography image processing color balance global adjustment intensity color typically red green blue primary color important goal adjustment render specific color particularly neutral color like white grey correctly hence general method sometimes called gray balance neutral balance white balance color balance change overall mixture color image used color correction generalized version color balance used correct color neutral deliberately change effect white balance one common kind balancing color adjusted make white object piece paper wall appear white shade colour image data acquired

including acquisition sensor match sensor human eye property display medium must accounted ambient viewing condition acquisition differ display viewing condition the color balance operation popular image editing application usually operate directly red green blue channel pixel value without respect color sensing reproduction model film photography color balance typically achieved using color correction filter light camera lens sometimes adjustment keep neutral neutral called white balance phrase color balance refers adjustment addition make color displayed image appear general appearance color original scene particularly important neutral gray neutral white color scene appear neutral reproduction human relate flesh tone critically color tree grass sky without concern human flesh tone

entire brightness range most digital camera mean select color correction based type scene lighting using either manual lighting selection automatic white balance custom white balance the algorithm

bayesian method color balancing image affect neutral color well image color balanced said color cast everything image appears shifted towards one color page needed color balancing may thought term removing color cast color balance also related color constancy algorithm technique used attain color constancy frequently used color balancing well color constancy turn related chromatic adaptation conceptually color balancing consists two step first determining illuminant image captured second scaling component e.g. image otherwise transforming component conform viewing illuminant viggiano found white balancing camera native rgb color model tended produce le color inconstancy i.e. le distortion color monitor rgb hypothetical set camera sensitivity this difference typically amounted factor two favor camera rgb this mean advantageous get color balance right time image captured rather edit later monitor one must color balance later balancing raw image data tend produce le
