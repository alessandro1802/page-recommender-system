In mathematics, the Lehmer mean of a tuple     x   {\displaystyle x}   of positive real numbers, named after Derrick Henry Lehmer,[1] is defined as: The weighted Lehmer mean with respect to a tuple     w   {\displaystyle w}   of positive weights is defined as: The Lehmer mean is an alternative to power means for interpolating between minimum and maximum via arithmetic mean and harmonic mean. The derivative of     p â†¦  L  p   (  x  )   {\displaystyle p\mapsto L_{p}(\mathbf {x} )}   is non-negative thus this function is monotonic and the inequality holds. The derivative of the weighted Lehmer mean is: Like a power mean, a Lehmer mean serves a non-linear moving average which is shifted towards small signal values for small     p   {\displaystyle p}   and emphasizes big signal values for big     p   {\displaystyle p}  . Given an efficient implementation of a moving arithmetic mean called smooth you can implement a moving Lehmer mean according to the following Haskell code. Gonzalez and Woods call this a "contraharmonic mean filter" described for varying values of p (however, as above, the contraharmonic mean can refer to the specific case     p = 2   {\displaystyle p=2}  ). Their convention is to substitute p with the order of the filter Q: Q=0 is the arithmetic mean. Positive Q can reduce pepper noise and negative Q can reduce salt noise.[2]
