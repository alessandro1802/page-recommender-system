winter would leave bologna warmer climate tuscany florence marconi noted important mentor professor vincenzo rosa high school physic teacher livorno rosa taught marconi basic physical phenomenon well new theory electricity age back bologna marconi became acquainted university bologna physicist augusto righi done research heinrich hertz work righi permitted marconi attend lecture university also use university laboratory library from youth marconi interested science electricity early began working idea wireless telegraphy —i.e. transmission telegraph message without connecting wire used electric telegraph this new idea numerous investigator inventor exploring wireless telegraph technology even building system using electric conduction electromagnetic induction optical light signalling year none proven technically commercially successful relatively new development came heinrich hertz demonstrated one could produce detect electromagnetic radiation based work james clerk maxwell time radiation commonly called hertzian wave generally referred radio wave there great deal interest radio wave physic community interest scientific phenomenon potential communication method physicist generally looked radio wave invisible form light could travel along line sight path limiting range visual horizon like existing form visual signaling hertz death brought published review earlier discovery including demonstration transmission detection radio wave british physicist oliver lodge article hertz work augusto righi righi article renewed marconi interest developing wireless telegraphy system based radio wave line inquiry marconi noted inventor seem pursuing age marconi began conduct experiment radio wave building much equipment attic home villa griffone pontecchio administrative subdivision sasso marconi italy help butler mignani marconi built hertz original experiment suggestion righi began using coherer early detector based finding french physicist édouard branly used lodge experiment changed resistance exposed radio wave summer built storm alarm made battery coherer electric bell went picked radio wave generated lightning late one night december marconi demonstrated radio transmitter receiver mother set-up made bell ring side room pushing telegraphic button bench supported father marconi continued read literature picked idea physicist experimenting radio wave developed device portable transmitter receiver system could work long distance turning essentially laboratory experiment useful communication system marconi came functional system many component summer marconi moved experiment outdoors father estate bologna tried different arrangement shape antenna even improvement able transmit signal one half-mile distance oliver lodge predicted maximum transmission distance radio wave breakthrough came summer marconi found much greater range could achieved raised height antenna borrowing technique used wired telegraphy grounded transmitter receiver with improvement system capable transmitting signal mile hill the monopole antenna reduced frequency wave compared dipole antenna used hertz radiated vertically polarized radio wave could travel longer distance point concluded device could become capable spanning greater distance additional funding research would prove valuable commercially militarily marconi experimental apparatus proved first engineering-complete commercially successful radio transmission system marconi applied ministry post telegraph direction maggiorino ferraris explaining wireless telegraph

annibale ferrero explaining marconi extraordinary discovery response ambassador ferrero advised reveal marconi result patent obtained also encouraged marconi come britain believed would easier find necessary fund convert experiment practical use finding little interest appreciation work italy marconi travelled london early age accompanied mother seek support work spoke fluent english addition italian marconi arrived dover custom officer opened case find various apparatus the custom officer immediately contacted admiralty london while marconi gained interest support william preece chief electrical engineer general post office gpo during time marconi decided patent system applied june british patent number titled improvement transmitting electrical impulse signal apparatus therefor
