upper increase mental physical function hence opposite drug class depressant stimulant antidepressant depressant widely used throughout world prescription medicine illicit substance alcohol prominent depressant alcohol likely large problem among teenager young adult when depressant used effect often include ataxia anxiolysis pain relief sedation somnolence cognitive memory impairment well instance euphoria dissociation muscle relaxation lowered blood pressure heart rate respiratory depression anticonvulsant effect depressant also act produce anesthesia cannabis may sometimes considered depressant due one component cannabidiol the latter known treat insomnia anxiety muscle spasm similar depressive drug however tetrahydrocannabinol another component may slow brain function small degree reducing reaction stimulus generally considered stimulant main psychoactive agent sometimes cause anxiety panic psychosis instead other depressant include drug like xanax benzodiazepine number
