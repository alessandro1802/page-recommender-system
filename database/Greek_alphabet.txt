cyprus the greek alphabet used write greek language since late early century bce derived earlier phoenician alphabet earliest known alphabetic script distinct letter vowel well consonant archaic early classical time greek alphabet existed many local variant end century bce euclidean alphabet letter ordered alpha omega become standard version still used greek writing today the uppercase lowercase

sound value conventional transcription letter differ ancient modern greek usage pronunciation greek changed significantly century bce today modern ancient greek also use different diacritic modern greek keeping stress accent acute diaeresis apart use writing greek language ancient modern form greek alphabet today also serf source technical symbol label many domain mathematics science field ancient modern greek letter greek alphabet fairly stable consistent symbol-to-sound mapping making pronunciation word largely predictable ancient greek spelling generally near-phonemic for number letter sound value differ considerably ancient modern greek pronunciation followed set systematic phonological shift affected language post-classical stage among consonant letter letter denoted voiced plosive consonant aspirated plosive /pʰ kʰ/ ancient greek stand corresponding fricative sound modern greek the correspondence follows among vowel symbol modern greek sound value reflect radical simplification vowel system post-classical greek merging multiple formerly distinct vowel phoneme much smaller number this lead several group vowel letter denoting identical sound today modern greek orthography remains true historical spelling case consequence spelling word modern greek often predictable pronunciation alone reverse mapping spelling pronunciation usually regular predictable the following vowel letter digraph involved merger modern greek speaker typically use modern symbol–sound mapping reading greek historical stage country student ancient greek may use variety conventional approximation historical sound system pronouncing ancient greek several letter combination special conventional sound value different single component among several digraph vowel letter formerly
