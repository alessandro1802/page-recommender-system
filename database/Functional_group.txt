organic chemistry functional group substituent moiety molecule cause molecule characteristic chemical reaction the functional group undergo similar chemical reaction regardless rest molecule composition this enables systematic prediction chemical reaction behavior chemical compound design chemical synthesis the reactivity functional group modified functional group nearby functional group interconversion used retrosynthetic analysis plan organic synthesis functional group group atom molecule distinctive chemical property regardless atom molecule the atom functional group linked rest molecule covalent bond for repeating unit polymer functional group attach nonpolar core carbon atom thus add chemical character carbon chain functional group also charged e.g carboxylate salt –coo− turn molecule polyatomic ion complex ion functional group binding central atom coordination complex called ligand complexation solvation also caused specific interaction functional group common rule thumb like dissolve like shared mutually well-interacting functional group give rise solubility for example sugar dissolve water share hydroxyl functional group –oh hydroxyl interact strongly plus functional group electronegative atom attach functional group become polar otherwise nonpolar molecule containing functional group become polar become soluble aqueous environment combining name functional group name parent alkane generates termed systematic nomenclature naming organic compound traditional nomenclature first carbon atom carbon attache functional group called alpha carbon second beta carbon third gamma carbon etc another functional group carbon may named greek letter e.g. gamma-amine gamma-aminobutyric acid third carbon carbon chain attached carboxylic acid group iupac convention call numeric labeling position e.g acid traditional name various qualifier used label isomer example isopropanol iupac name isomer n-propanol the term moiety overlap term functional group however moiety entire half molecule single functional group also larger unit consisting multiple functional group for example aryl moiety may group containing aromatic ring regardless many functional group said aryl the following list common functional group formula symbol usually denote attached hydrogen hydrocarbon side chain length may sometimes refer group atom hydrocarbon class molecule defined functional group called hydrocarbyls contain carbon hydrogen vary number order double bond each one differs type scope reactivity there also large number branched ring alkane specific name e.g. tert-butyl bornyl cyclohexyl etc hydrocarbon may form charged structure positively charged carbocations negative carbanions carbocations often named -um example tropylium triphenylmethyl cation cyclopentadienyl anion haloalkane class molecule defined carbon–halogen bond this bond relatively weak case iodoalkane quite stable case fluoroalkane general exception fluorinated compound haloalkane readily undergo nucleophilic substitution reaction elimination reaction the substitution carbon acidity adjacent proton solvent condition etc influence outcome reactivity compound contain c-o bond posse differing reactivity based upon location hybridization c-o bond owing electron-withdrawing effect sp-hybridized oxygen carbonyl group donating effect oxygen alcohol group compound contain nitrogen category may contain c-o bond case amide acetimidamide alkyl nitrate alkyl nitrite compound contain sulfur exhibit unique chemistry due ability form bond oxygen lighter analogue periodic table substitutive nomenclature marked prefix table preferred functional class nomenclature marked suffix table sulfide disulfides sulfoxides sulfones compound contain phosphorus exhibit unique chemistry due ability form bond nitrogen lighter analogue periodic table compound containing boron exhibit unique chemistry due partially filled octet therefore acting lewis acid methyllithium methylmagnesium chloride trimethylaluminium trimethylsilyl triflate note fluorine electronegative bonded magnesium becomes ionic salt instead these name used refer moiety radical specie also form name halide substituents larger molecule when parent hydrocarbon unsaturated suffix -yl -ylidene -ylidyne replaces -ane e.g ethane becomes ethyl otherwise suffix replaces final e.g ethyne becomes ethynyl when used refer moiety multiple single bond differ single multiple bond for example methylene bridge methanediyl two single bond whereas methylene group methylidene one double bond suffix combined methylidyne triple bond vs. methylylidene single bond double bond vs. methanetriyl three double bond there retained name methylene methanediyl x-phenylene x-diyl carbyne methylidyne trityl triphenylmethyl
