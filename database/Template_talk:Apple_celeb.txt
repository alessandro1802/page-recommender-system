Since there's no guidelines for using this template, I thought I should post this instead of just doing it: Any list of important people at Apple that includes these people should probably also include Bill Atkinson, the inventor of QuickDraw, HyperCard, MacPaint (not to mention round rectangles, pull down menu, marching ants, etc). -- Steven Fisher 00:25, 4 June 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I recommend sorting them by joined date. Does anyone know enough to do this? I'm not sure if the necessary information is available in all the articles. Any alternative proposals? - Samsara (talk • contribs) 18:39, 8 June 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I've protected this template as an edit war (whether to use standard {{navigation}} or not) has got out of hand, getting close to personal attacks, and certainly invoking incivility.  Please resolve it here - I suggest that you get a third opinion. Martinp23 15:24, 27 November 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Template "navigation" should not be used here because this template (Apple celeb) is only one line and therefore does not need a hide button. Offering UI elements that aren't going to help people does not make sense. I have therefore gone out of my way to create a similar template without this button, {{navigation no hide}}. Tasc, on the other hand, has simply reverted all changes made by me, and tried to force his vision of a unified world on everybody else. My opinion is that we must be able to accept plurality in template space. - Samsara (talk • contribs) 12:58, 29 November 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] You may also wish to familiarise yourself with Wikipedia:NavFrame to understand when use of the hide button is warranted.

The <div> and/or {{nowrap begin}}–{{·w}}–{{nowrap end}} may or may not be "standard", but the latter certainly seems to avoid the occasional linewrap problem reintroduced with the {{·}}s. Would you reconsider your edit, please? Sardanaphalus (talk) 12:19, 30 March 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Should Craig Federighi be added to this template? I may do so if no one chimes in.Mercurywoodrose (talk) 18:07, 12 June 2013 (UTC)Reply[reply]
