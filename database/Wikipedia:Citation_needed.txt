To ensure that all Wikipedia content is verifiable, Wikipedia provides a means for anyone to question an uncited claim. If your work has been tagged, please provide a reliable source for the statement, and discuss if needed. You can add a citation by selecting from the drop-down  menu at the top of the editing box. In markup, you can add a citation manually using ref tags. There are also more elaborate ways to cite sources. In wiki markup, you can question an uncited claim by inserting a simple {{Citation needed}} tag, or a more comprehensive {{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=November 2022}}. Alternatively, {{fact}} and {{cn}} will produce the same result. These all display as:  Example: 87 percent of statistics are made up on the spot.[citation needed] For information on adding citations in articles, see Help:Referencing for beginners. For information on when to remove this template messages, see Help:Maintenance template removal. A "citation needed" tag is a request for another editor to supply a source for the tagged fact: a form of communication between members of a collaborative editing community. It is never, in itself, an "improvement" of an article. Though readers may be alerted by a "citation needed" that a particular statement is not supported, and even doubted by some, many readers don't fully understand the community's processes. Not all tags get addressed in a timely manner, staying in place for months or years, forming an ever-growing Wikipedia backlogâ€”this itself can be a problem. Best practice recommends the following:  Before adding a tag, at least consider the following alternatives, one of which may prove much more constructive: Currently, there are 474,945 articles with "Citation needed" statements. You can browse the whole list of these articles at Category:All articles with unsourced statements. Frequently the authors of statements do not return to Wikipedia to support the statement with citations, so other Wikipedia editors have to do work checking those statements. With 474,945 statements that need WP:Verification, sometimes it's hard to choose which article to work on. The tool Citation Hunt makes that easier by suggesting random articles, which you can sort by topical category membership.
