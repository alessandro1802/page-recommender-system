wishful thinking formation belief based might pleasing imagine rather evidence rationality reality product resolving conflict belief desire methodology examine wishful thinking diverse various discipline school thought examine related mechanism neural circuitry human cognition emotion type bias procrastination motivation optimism attention environment this concept examined fallacy related concept wishful seeing some psychologist believe positive thinking able positively influence behavior bring better result this called pygmalion effect christopher booker described wishful thinking term study consistently shown holding else equal subject predict positive outcome likely negative outcome see unrealistic optimism however research suggests certain circumstance threat increase reverse phenomenon occurs addition cognitive bias poor way making decision wishful thinking commonly held specific informal fallacy argument assumed wish something true false actually true false this fallacy form wish true/false therefore true/false wishful thinking true would rely upon appeal emotion would also red herring wishful thinking may cause blindness unintended consequence wishful seeing phenomenon person internal state influence visual perception people tendency believe perceive world research suggests otherwise currently two main type wishful seeing based wishful seeing occursâ€”in categorization object representation environment the concept wishful seeing first introduced new look approach psychology the new look approach popularized work jerome bruner cecile goodman classic study asked child demonstrate perception size coin manipulating diameter circular aperture wooden box each child held coin left hand height distance aperture operated knob change size aperture right hand the child divided three group two experimental one control ten child group the control group asked estimate size coin-sized cardboard disc instead actual coin average child experimental group overestimated size coin thirty percent second iteration experiment bruner goodman divided child group based economic status again poor rich group asked estimate size real coin manipulating diameter aperture expected group overestimated size coin poor group overestimated size much fifty percent thirty percent rich group from result bruner goodman concluded poorer child felt greater desire money thus perceived coin larger this hypothesis formed basis new look psychological approach suggests subjective experience object influence visual perception object some psychodynamic psychologist adopted view new look approach order explain individual might protect disturbing visual stimulus the psychodynamic perspective lost support lacked sufficient model account unconscious could influence perception although research able replicate result found bruner goodman new look approach mostly abandoned experiment riddled methodological error account confounding factor reporter bias context recent research brought revival new look perspective methodological improvement resolve outstanding issue plagued original study this process occurs threat increase the ebbinghaus illusion used measure reverse wishful seeing participant observing negative flanker target underestimated le positive neutral target feeling fear also lead perception feared object closer prior research suggests desired object perceived closer furthermore people le inclined wishful thinking/seeing based emotional state personality concrete cognitive mechanism underlying wishful thinking wishful seeing unknown since concept still developing research mechanism contributing phenomenon still progress however mechanism proposed wishful thinking could attributed three mechanism attentional bias interpretation bias response bias therefore three different stage cognitive processing wishful thinking could arise first lowest stage cognitive processing individual selectively attend cue individual attend evidence support desire neglect contradictory evidence second wishful thinking could generated selective interpretation cue case individual changing attention cue attribution importance cue finally wishful thinking arise higher stage cognitive processing forming response cue inserting bias wishful seeing attributed mechanism wishful thinking involves processing situational cue including visual cue however preconscious processing visual cue association desirable outcome interpretation bias response bias plausible since occur conscious cognitive processing stage therefore fourth mechanism called perceptual set also explain phenomenon this mechanism proposes mental state association activated object come view subtly guide visual system processing therefore cue readily recognized related mental state association some speculate wishful seeing result cognitive penetrability higher cognitive function able directly influence perceptual experience instead influencing perception higher level processing those argue cognitive penetrability feel sensory system operate modular fashion cognitive state exerting influence stimulus perceived the phenomenon wishful seeing implicates cognitive penetrability perceptual experience wishful seeing observed occur early stage categorization research using ambiguous figure binocular rivalry exhibit tendency perception influenced top-down bottom-up processing visual processing bottom-up processing rigid route compared flexible top-down processing within bottom-up processing stimulus recognized fixation point proximity focal area build object top-down processing context sensitive this effect observed via priming well emotional state the traditional hierarchical model information processing describe early visual processing one-way street early visual processing go conceptual system conceptual system affect visual process currently research reject model suggests conceptual information penetrate early visual processing rather biasing perceptual system this occurrence called conceptual cognitive penetrability research conceptual penetrability utilize stimulus conceptual-category pair measure reaction time determine category effect influenced visual processing the category effect difference reaction time within pair test conceptual penetrability simultaneous sequential judgment pair the reaction time decreased stimulus onset asynchrony increased supporting category affect visual representation conceptual penetrability research richer stimulus figure cat dog allow greater perceptual variability analysis stimulus typicality cat dog arranged various position le typical recognition differentiating picture took longer within category doga-dogb compared category dog-cat supporting category knowledge influence categorization therefore visual processing measured physical differential judgment affected non-visual processing supporting conceptual penetrability the area brain motivate wishful seeing thinking associated region underlie social identification reward study looked structure using mri participant estimated winning probability series football team prior estimation individual specified favorite

wishful thinking task differential activity found three area brain dorsal medial prefrontal cortex parietal lobe fusiform gyrus occipital lobe differential activity occipital parietal area suggests mode selective attention cue presented therefore supporting lower-level cognitive processing attention bias however differential activity prefrontal cortex also suggests higher-cognitive processing the prefrontal cortex activity related preference involved social identification result cue relevant individual favorite football team prefrontal cortex activated this identification self carry hedonic value turn stimulates reward system differential activation reward system area seen conjunction activation occipital lobe thus activation reward system identification self could lead guidance visual attention magnocellular parvocellular pathway feed orbitofrontal cortex play important role top-down process susceptible cognitive penetrability magnocellular processing biased stimulus deferentially activates orbitofrontal cortex fast magnocellular projection link early visual inferotemporal object recognition work orbitofrontal cortex helping generate early object prediction based perceptual set stimulus m-biased low-luminance achromatic line drawing p-biased isoluminate chromatic line drawing participant asked drawing larger smaller shoebox functional magnetic resonance imaging used monitor brain activity orbitofrontal cortex ventrotemporal region determine pathway aided faster object recognition the result supported magnocellular neuron play vital role low-resolution object recognition neuron aid quickly triggering top-down process provide initial guess lead faster object recognition human physiologically limited visual field must selectively directed certain stimulus attention cognitive process allows task accomplished might responsible phenomenon wishful seeing expectation desire fear among various factor help direct attention consequently cognitive experience opportunity influence perceptual experience turn attention organize planned movement providing mechanism visual stimulus influence behavior attentional deficit also lead altered perceptual experience inattentional blindness unexpected event undetected one deficit using inattentional blindness paradigm researcher white davy participant fixate cross center screen first number cue denoting number letter would appear arm cross appeared center cross following cue actual letter would appear arm cross over four trial number letter matched number cued fifth trial half participant cued expect smaller number letter half cued expect correct number letter the letter appeared screen accompanied unexpected stimulus participant asked letter appeared whether seen additional object participant cued expect fewer letter susceptible inattentional blindness failed detect unexpected stimulus often participant cued expect correct number stimulus these result indicate attentional capacity affected expectation this provides evidence cognitive process converge order help construct perceptual experience although attention lead enhanced perceptual processing lack attention stimulus also lead perceived enhanced perception stimulus participant pre-cued indicated diagonal attending they presented stimulus grating different texture response cue indicated diagonal participant judge perception time response cue matched pre-cue time match pre-cue the participant asked report texture grating appeared response-cue discriminate visibility this set-up allowed compare perception attended cued non-attended stimulus uncued higher visibility reported stimulus unattended therefore inattention lead overestimation perception sensitivity this study suggests attention bias mechanism wishful thinking rely individual fixate upon unattended stimulus well emotion often interpreted visual cue face body language context however context cultural background shown influence visual perception interpretation emotion cross-cultural difference change blindness associated perceptual set tendency attend visual scene particular way for example eastern culture tend emphasize background object western culture focus central object scene perceptual set also result cultural aesthetic preference therefore cultural context influence people sample information face like would situational context for example caucasian generally fixate around eye nose mouth asian fixate eye individual different cultural background shown series face asked sort pile every face showed emotion fixation different feature face lead disparate reading emotion asian focus eye lead perception startled face surprise rather fear result previous association custom individual lead different categorization recognition emotion this particular difference visual perception emotion seems suggest attention bias mechanism wishful seeing since certain visual cue attended e.g nose eye others ignored e.g mouth wishful seeing also linked optimism bias individual tend expect positive outcome event despite expectation little basis reality order determine neural correlate underlying optimism bias one functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri study imaged brain individual recalled autobiographical moment related life event rated memory several scale these rating revealed participant viewed future positive event positive past positive event negative event temporally distant the active brain region compared fixation point rostral anterior cingulate cortex racc right amygdala both area became le active imagining negative future event the racc implicated assessing emotional content strong connection amygdala suggested racc regulates activation brain region associated emotion autobiographical memory thus allowing projection positivity onto image future event important consider physical aspect eye movement brain activity relationship wishful thinking wishful seeing optimism

optimism correlated le fixated gaze skin cancer image despite fact image relevant participant wishful thinking often studied context psychology application ambiguous figure study hypothesis presented ambiguous stimulus participant interpret stimulus certain way depending condition priming participant experience balcetis dunning investigated wishful seeing conducting two experiment one involving two ambiguous stimulus could perceived either horse seal the second experiment binocular rivalry test participant presented simultaneously letter number one stimulus eye experiment experimenter associated one stimulus desirable outcome negative outcome i.e associated freshly squeezed orange juice associated undesirable health food smoothie binocular rivalry experiment letter associated economic gain number associated economic loss the result experiment demonstrated participant likely perceive stimulus associated positive situation outcome stimulus associated negative situation this strong correlation perception positive versus negative stimulus demonstrates tend see world based desire the concept wishful seeing hint towards motivation-based perception process balcetis dale considered view world biased way four-prong study one part addressed motivated object interpretation using situation involving interpretation ambiguous object i.e necker cube lack language based label priming information may suggest participant many study claim human perceive see based internal motivation goal important consider priming situation certain study even internal view participant affect interpretation stimulus with consideration mind balcetis dale divided cornell university undergraduate three group asked imagine one three detailed condition upward-looking condition participant asked imagine looking large building downward-looking position looking deep canyon neutral/flat condition standing flat field the participant shown ambiguous necker cube computer screen told click one two blue line seemed closest the line participant chose depended whether determined cube facing upwards downwards the result study demonstrated majority participant upward-looking condition saw cube facing upwards majority downwards-looking conditioned patient saw cube facing downwards participant neutral condition evenly divided these result show priming stimulus language influenced object identification motivation-affected object identification observed condition similar result seen study conducted changizi hall addressed wishful thinking goal-oriented object identification investigating level thirst among participant relation tendency identify ambiguously transparent stimulus transparent study state transparency natural yet unobvious quality directly related water typically clear substance the result study showed clear tendency thirsty participant directed eat bag potato chip immediately preceding study interpret ambiguous stimulus transparent furthermore participant thirsty directed drink water study reported thirsty le likely interpret ambiguous stimulus transparent the study concludes alteration biological state case participant level thirstiness inspires wishful thinking directly affect perception visual stimulus bastardi uhlmann ross showed effect wishful thinking presented parent two fictional study involving day care versus home care child the parent conflicted planned use day care despite believing home care superior positively rated study claimed day care superior negatively rated study claimed home care better the unconflicted parent thought home care superior day care planned use home care rated study claimed home care better positively the parent rated study claimed actually planned child superior action even though case conflicted parent study may opposition original belief post-experiment evaluation conflicted parent changed initial belief claimed believe home care better day care unconflicted parent continued claim home care superior though lesser degree balcetis dunning used natural ambiguity found judging distance measure effect wishful seeing during study participant judged distance various stimulus experimenter manipulated desirability stimulus one study participant thirst intensified consuming large portion daily sodium intake quenched drinking satiety they asked estimate distance bottle water those participant thirstier ranked bottle water desirable viewed closer le thirsty participant another study performed balcetis dunning participant estimate distance test result contained either positive negative feedback gift card possibility either winning participant viewed form closer contained positive feedback gift card closer possibility might win balcetis dunning took account possible influence positive mood measuring creativity word creation task arousal physiological marker the experimenter also eliminated reporter bias one study participant throw beanbag toward gift card adhered floor underthrowing beanbag indicated participant perceived gift card closer overthrowing beanbag indicated participant perceived gift card away their result suggest positivity bias perception distance the relationship distance perception positivity may complicated originally thought context also influence distortion perception fact threatening situation positivity bias may put aside enable appropriate response turn perceptual exaggeration brought threatening stimulus negated psychosocial resource psychosocial resource defined resource perception model rpm social support self-worth self- esteem self-efficacy hope optimism perceived control self-disclosure the participant reported distance measure experimenter manipulated self-worth participant mental imagery exercise well exposure threatening tarantula non-threatening cat toy stimulus effect self-worth observed upon exposure threatening stimulus increased self-worth correlated realistic estimate distance threatening stimulus another common area wishful seeing observed environmental representation many study supported desire motivation effect estimate size distance speed length slope environment target for example people perceive desired object closer wishful seeing also effect athlete perception ball equipment for example softball player see ball bigger hit better tennis player return better see net lower ball moving slower distance slope perception effected energy level subject heavier load see hill steeper distance farther target placed uphill compared flat ground seem farther away people shape perceive hill shallower fatigued runner see hill steeper this perception modulated coined efficient energy expenditure word perceived increase effort steeper slope physically exhausted might prompt individual rest rather expend energy distance perception also effected cognitive dissonance cognitive dissonance manipulated high choice group led believe selected wearing carmen miranda outfit walk across campus versus low choice group told wear outfit reduce cognitive dissonance high choice group subject changed attitude match situation thus perceived environment le extreme way shorter distance low choice group similar result followed perception slope test participant high low choice group push slope skateboard arm again high choice group perceived slope shallower low choice order reduce cognitive dissonance both study suggest intrapsychic motif play role perception environment order encourage perceiver engage behavior lead either acquire desired object able complete desired task sigall kruglanski fyock found people assessed high wishful thinker likely procrastinate motivated told task unpleasant when told task going pleasant little difference amount procrastination showing motivated wishful thinker may consider capable task lesser amount time therefore exhibiting wishful thinking considering capable result put working unpleasant task
