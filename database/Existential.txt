marcel later came reject label favour neo-socratic honor kierkegaard essay concept irony some scholar argue term used refer cultural movement europe associated work philosopher sartre simone beauvoir maurice merleau-ponty albert camus others extend term kierkegaard yet others extend far back socrates however often identified philosophical view sartre the label existentialism existentialist often seen historical convenience much first applied many philosopher long died while existentialism generally considered originated kierkegaard first prominent existentialist philosopher adopt term self-description sartre sartre posit idea existentialist common fundamental doctrine existence precedes essence philosopher frederick copleston explains according philosopher steven crowell defining existentialism relatively difficult argues better understood general approach used reject certain systematic philosophy rather systematic philosophy lecture delivered sartre described existentialism attempt draw consequence position consistent atheism for others existentialism need involve rejection god rather examines mortal man search meaning meaningless universe considering le what good life feel good instead asking what life good although many outside scandinavia consider term existentialism originated kierkegaard likely kierkegaard adopted term least term existential description philosophy norwegian poet literary critic johan sebastian cammermeyer welhaven this assertion come two source sartre argued central proposition existentialism existence precedes essence say individual shape existing perceived preconceived priori category essence the actual life individual constitutes could called true essence instead arbitrarily attributed essence others use define human being consciousness create value determine meaning life this view contradiction aristotle aquinas taught essence precedes individual existence although sartre explicitly coined phrase similar notion found thought existentialist philosopher heidegger kierkegaard the subjective thinker form form communication style his form must manifold opposite hold together the systematic eins zwei drei abstract form also must inevitably run trouble whenever applied concrete degree subjective thinker concrete degree form must also concretely dialectical but poet ethicist dialectician also form none directly his form must first last related existence regard must disposal poetic ethical dialectical religious subordinate character setting etc. belong well-balanced character esthetic production breadth subjective thinker one setting—existence—and nothing locality thing the setting fairyland imagination poetry produce consummation setting laid england historical accuracy concern the setting inwardness existing human concretion relation existence-categories one another historical accuracy historical actuality breadth.some interpret imperative define oneself meaning anyone wish anything however existentialist philosopher would say wish constitutes inauthentic existence sartre would call bad faith instead phrase taken say people defined insofar act responsible action someone act cruelly towards people act defined cruel person such person responsible new identity cruel person this opposed gene human nature bearing blame sartre said lecture existentialism humanism man first exists encounter surge world—and defines afterwards the positive therapeutic aspect also implied person choose act different way good person instead cruel person jonathan webber interprets sartre usage term essence modal fashion i.e necessary feature teleological fashion essence relational property set part ordered way collectively perform activity for example belongs essence house keep bad weather wall roof human different house because—unlike houses—they inbuilt purpose free choose purpose thereby shape essence thus existence precedes essence sartre committed radical conception freedom nothing fix purpose project weight inertia except endorsement simone beauvoir hand hold various factor grouped together term sedimentation offer resistance attempt change direction life sedimentation product past choice changed choosing differently present change happen slowly they force inertia shape agent evaluative outlook world transition complete sartre definition existentialism based heidegger magnum opus being time correspondence jean beaufret later published letter humanism heidegger implied sartre misunderstood purpose subjectivism mean action take precedence long action reflected upon heidegger commented reversal metaphysical statement remains metaphysical statement meaning thought sartre simply switched role traditionally attributed essence existence without interrogating concept history the notion absurd contains idea meaning world beyond meaning give this meaninglessness also encompasses amorality unfairness world this highlighted way opposes traditional abrahamic religious perspective establishes life purpose fulfillment god commandment this give meaning people life live life absurd mean rejecting life find pursues specific meaning man existence since nothing discovered according albert camus world human absurd the concept emerges juxtaposition two life becomes absurd due incompatibility human being world inhabit this view constitutes one two interpretation absurd existentialist literature the second view first elaborated søren kierkegaard hold absurdity limited action choice human being these considered absurd since issue human freedom undermining foundation outside the absurd contrast claim bad thing n't happen good people world metaphorically speaking thing good person bad person happens happens may well happen good person bad person because world absurdity anything happen anyone time tragic event could plummet someone direct confrontation absurd many literary work kierkegaard samuel beckett franz kafka fyodor dostoyevsky eugène ionesco miguel unamuno luigi pirandello sartre joseph heller camus contain description people encounter absurdity world devastating awareness meaninglessness camus claimed the myth sisyphus there one truly serious philosophical problem suicide although prescription possible deleterious consequence kind encounter vary kierkegaard religious stage camus insistence persevering spite absurdity concern helping people avoid living life way put perpetual danger everything meaningful break common existentialist philosopher the possibility everything meaningful break pose threat quietism inherently existentialist philosophy said possibility suicide make human existentialist the ultimate hero absurdism life without meaning face suicide without succumbing facticity defined sartre being nothingness in-itself delineates human modality fact personal life per heidegger way thrown world this easily understood considering facticity relation temporal dimension past one past one co-constitutes oneself however say one one past would ignore significant part reality present future saying one past one would entirely detach oneself denial one concrete past constitutes inauthentic lifestyle also applies kind facticity human body—e.g. one allow person run faster speed sound—identity value etc. facticity limitation condition freedom limitation large part one facticity consists thing one choose birthplace etc condition freedom sense one value likely depend however even though one facticity set stone past instance determine person value ascribed one facticity still ascribed freely person example consider two men one memory past remembers everything both committed many crime first man remembering nothing lead rather normal life second man feeling trapped past continues life crime blaming past trapping life there nothing essential committing crime ascribes meaning past however disregard one facticity continual process self-making projecting oneself future would put oneself denial oneself would inauthentic the origin one projection must still one facticity though mode essentially example one focusing solely possible project without reflecting one current facticity would someone continually think future possibility related rich e.g better car bigger house better quality life etc without acknowledging facticity currently financial mean example considering facticity transcendence authentic mode would considering future project might improve one current finance e.g putting extra hour investing saving order arrive future-facticity modest pay rise leading purchase affordable car another aspect facticity entail angst freedom produce angst limited facticity lack possibility facticity step take responsibility something one done also produce angst another aspect existential freedom one change one value one responsible one value regardless society value the focus freedom existentialism related limit responsibility one bear result one freedom the relationship freedom responsibility one interdependency clarification freedom also clarifies one responsible many noted existentialist consider theme authentic existence important authenticity involves idea one create oneself live accordance self for authentic existence one act oneself one act one gene essence requires the authentic act one accordance one freedom component freedom facticity degree facticity determines one transcendent choice one could blame one background making choice one made chosen project one transcendence facticity relation authenticity involves acting one actual value making choice instead like kierkegaard aesthete choosing randomly one take responsibility act instead choosing either-or without allowing option different value contrast inauthentic denial live accordance one freedom this take many form pretending choice meaningless random convincing oneself form determinism true mimicry one act one citation needed how one act often determined image one one role bank manager lion tamer prostitute etc act being nothingness sartre us example waiter bad faith merely take part act typical waiter albeit convincingly this image usually corresponds social norm mean acting accordance social norm inauthentic the main point attitude one take one freedom responsibility extent one act accordance freedom the other written capital concept properly belonging phenomenology account intersubjectivity however seen widespread use existentialist writing conclusion drawn differ slightly phenomenological account the other experience another free subject inhabits world person basic form experience other constitutes intersubjectivity objectivity clarify one experience someone else other person experience world world person experience —only —the world constituted objective something identical subject person experience person experiencing thing this experience other look termed look sometimes gaze while experience basic phenomenological sense constitutes world objective oneself objectively existing subjectivity one experience oneself seen other look precisely way one experience other seen subjectivity existentialism also act kind limitation freedom this look tends objectify see when one experience oneself look one experience oneself nothing thing something thing sartre example man peeping someone keyhole man entirely caught situation pre-reflexive state entire consciousness directed go room suddenly hears creaking floorboard behind becomes aware seen other filled shame perceives would perceive someone else doing—as peeping tom for sartre phenomenological experience shame establishes proof existence mind defeat problem solipsism for conscious state shame experienced one become aware oneself object another look proving priori mind exist the look co-constitutive one facticity another characteristic feature look other really need possible creaking floorboard simply movement old house look kind mystical telepathic experience actual way other see one may someone could noticed person one perception way another might perceive citation needed existential angst sometimes called existential dread anxiety anguish term common many existentialist thinker generally held negative feeling arising experience human freedom responsibility the archetypal example experience one standing cliff one fear falling also dread possibility throwing oneself experience nothing holding back one sens lack anything predetermines one either throw oneself stand still one experience one freedom also seen relation previous point angst nothing set apart fear object while one take measure remove object fear angst constructive measure possible the use word nothing context relates inherent insecurity consequence one action fact experiencing freedom angst one also realizes one fully responsible consequence there nothing people genetically instance act stead—that blame something go wrong therefore every choice perceived dreadful possible consequence claimed human life would unbearable every choice facilitated dread however change fact freedom remains condition every action despair generally defined loss hope existentialism specifically loss hope reaction breakdown one defining quality one self identity person invested particular thing bus driver upstanding citizen find being-thing compromised would normally found state despair—a hopeless state for example singer loses ability sing may despair nothing else fall back on—nothing rely identity they find unable defined what set existentialist notion despair apart conventional definition existentialist despair state one even overtly despair long person identity depends quality crumble perpetual despair—and sartrean term human essence found conventional reality constitute individual sense identity despair universal human condition kierkegaard defines either/or let one learn learn person unhappiness never lie lack control external condition since would make completely unhappy work love say when god-forsaken worldliness earthly life shuts complacency confined air develops poison moment get stuck stand still prospect lost need felt refreshing enlivening breeze cleanse air dispel poisonous vapor lest suffocate worldliness ... lovingly hope thing opposite despairingly hope nothing love hope things—yet never put shame relate oneself expectantly possibility good hope relate oneself expectantly possibility evil fear decision choose hope one decides infinitely seems eternal decision.existentialists oppose defining human being primarily rational therefore oppose positivism rationalism existentialism asserts people make decision based subjective meaning rather pure rationality the rejection reason source meaning common theme existentialist thought focus anxiety dread feel face radical free awareness death kierkegaard advocated rationality mean interact objective world e.g. natural science come existential problem reason insufficient human reason boundary like kierkegaard sartre saw problem rationality calling form bad faith attempt self impose structure world phenomena— other —that fundamentally irrational random according sartre rationality form bad faith hinder people finding meaning freedom try suppress feeling anxiety dread people confine within everyday experience sartre asserted thereby relinquishing freedom acquiescing possessed one form another look other i.e. possessed another person—or least one idea person existentialist reading bible would demand reader recognize existing subject studying word recollection event this contrast looking collection truth outside unrelated reader may develop sense reality/god such reader obligated follow commandment external agent forcing commandment upon though inside guiding inside this task kierkegaard take asks who difficult task teacher lecture earnest thing meteor distance everyday life—or learner put use although nihilism existentialism distinct philosophy often confused one another since rooted human experience anguish confusion stem apparent meaninglessness world human compelled find create meaning primary cause confusion friedrich nietzsche important philosopher field existentialist philosopher often stress importance angst signifying absolute lack objective ground action move often reduced moral existential nihilism pervasive theme existentialist philosophy however persist encounter absurd seen camus the myth sisyphus one must imagine sisyphus happy rarely existentialist philosopher dismiss morality one
