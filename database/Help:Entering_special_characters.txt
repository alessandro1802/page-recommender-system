redhat-like linux distribution example use html character reference the reference either named numeric either type begin ampersand end semicolon named reference form name example agrave refers lower-case latin grave accent because name reasonably mnemonic usually easier remember numerical code accordingly easier editor recognize some unicode character turkish letter html name numerical reference sometimes option using html html numeric character reference form character unicode code point decimal hexadecimal for example either entered give dash because character unicode code point usually given hexadecimal prefixed hexadecimal code arguably convenient course name exists named reference e.g. mdash dash usually convenient easily recognized either numerical code html character name corresponding hexadecimal decimal code given list xml html character entity reference because character reference us ascii character require web browser support unicode unambiguous web page announce character encoding browser encoding incorrectly manually set even character display properly browser accordingly usually web safe approach however character reference distracting many editor may cause difficulty search wikipedia see some old browser incorrectly interpret code range reference native character set because code point used displayable glyph either unicode character reference range illegal html ambiguous though commonly used many web site almost browser treat printable character space often found way article title english project really caused confusion trying create interwiki link said page generally speaking western european language spanish french german pose problem for specific detail language turkey see help turkish character more may added list contributor language appear although according deletion discussion may little need list future e.g. hiero /hiero give see help wikihiero syntax this dependent browser capability us image server hieroglyph also represented unicode using aegyptus font mediawiki installation configured esperanto use storage display however editing text converted form designed easier edit standard keyboard the character applies you may enter directly edit box facility however edit page see encoded this form referred x-sistemo x-kodo order preserve round-trip capability one follow character non-accented form number edit box double number actual stored article text for example interlanguage link luxury car luxury car entered edit box luxxury car this caused problem interwiki update bot past some browser known nasty thing text edit box most commonly convert encoding native platform whilst line window internally byte subset complete duplicate set apis window ansi code page many older apps tend use especially thing like edit box then let user edit using standard edit control convert back the result character exist encoding used editing get replaced something often question mark though least one browser reported actually transliterate text google chrome chromium cross-platform bug prevents use font substitution this mean even user correct typeface given script installed may display correctly lynx link text mode convert console character set lynx link actually using transliteration engine editing convert back save console character set browser unicode safe unsafe with lynx link possible detection method would add another edit box login form n't work n't convert text console character set user actually attempt edit after english wikipedia switched interwiki bot started replacing html entity interwikis literal unicode text edits broke unicode character became common could longer ignored workaround developed allow problematic browser edit safely provided mediawiki knew problem browser listed setting wgbrowserblacklist list regexps match user agent string supplied text editing special form existing hexadecimal html entity page extra leading zero added non-ascii character stored wikitext represented hexadecimal html entity leading zero currently default setting mac specific version netscape linux blacklist nevertheless seems stopped problem hopefully default list expanded future relies getting someone cv access commit change many user setting giving underlined link when linking special character case result may mistaken another character different meaning linking give may look like case one better use separate link there le risk confusion one character linked e.g wikipedia search easier special character entered unicode html entity used word like odiliënberg found searching odili euml nberg combination thereof actually bug fixed—the entity folded raw character equivalent search equivalent see also help searching
