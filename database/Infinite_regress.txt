expressed following form stand stand object stand relation stand property widest sense epistemic regress example belief justified based another belief justified but belief need one justified belief justified cosmological argument event occurred caused another event occurred caused previous event this principle sufficient lead regress this additional triggering condition fulfilled regress get started regress start fact according recursive principle possible distinct also but order account fact need posit once regress started way stopping since new entity introduced step order make previous

mere existence infinite regress proof anything addition connecting theory recursive principle paired triggering condition argument show way resulting regress vicious for example one form evidentialism epistemology hold belief justified based another belief justified opponent theory could use infinite regress argument demonstrating theory lead infinite regress e.g pointing recursive principle triggering condition infinite regress vicious e.g showing implausible given limitation human mind example argument negative form since denies another theory true but also used positive form support theory showing alternative involves vicious regress this cosmological argument existence god work claim positing god existence necessary order avoid infinite regress cause for infinite regress argument successful show involved regress vicious non-vicious regress called virtuous benign traditionally often assumed without much argument infinite regress vicious assumption put question contemporary philosophy case self-evident whether infinite regress vicious the truth regress constitutes example infinite regress vicious proposition true proposition true also true infinite regress pose problem mostly regress concern concrete object abstract object hand often considered unproblematic respect for example truth-regress lead infinite number true proposition peano axiom entail existence infinitely many natural number but regress usually held theory entail there different way regress vicious the serious type viciousness involves contradiction form metaphysical impossibility other type occur infinite regress responsible theory question implausible failure solve problem formulated solve the vice infinite regress local cause problem certain theory combined assumption global otherwise for example otherwise virtuous regress locally vicious theory posit finite domain case infinite regress source problem merely indicates different underlying problem infinite regress involve metaphysical impossibility serious case viciousness the easiest way arrive result accepting assumption actual infinity impossible thereby directly leading contradiction this anti-infinitists position opposed infinity general specifically infinite regress but open defender theory question deny outright prohibition actual infinity for example argued certain type infinity problematic way like infinite intensive magnitude e.g infinite energy density but type infinity like infinite cardinality e.g infinitely many cause infinite extensive magnitude e.g duration universe history unproblematic point view metaphysical impossibility while may instance viciousness due metaphysical impossibility vicious regress problematic reason common form viciousness arises implausibility infinite regress question this category often applies theory human action state capacity this argument weaker argument impossibility since allows regress question possible denies actual for example seems implausible due limitation human mind justified belief entail agent need infinite amount but metaphysically impossible e.g assumed infinite number belief non-occurrent dispositional limitation applies number belief one actually thinking one moment another reason implausibility theory involving infinite regress due principle known ockham razor posit avoid ontological extravagance multiplying entity without necessity consideration parsimony complicated distinction quantitative qualitative parsimony concerning many entity posited contrast many kind entity posited for example cosmological argument existence god promise increase quantitative parsimony positing one first cause instead allowing infinite chain event but decreasing qualitative parsimony posit god new type entity another form viciousness applies infinite regress relation explanatory goal theory theory often formulated goal solving specific problem e.g answering question certain type entity exists one way attempt fail answer question already assumes disguised form supposed explain this akin informal fallacy begging question from perspective mythological world view example one way explain earth seems rest instead falling hold rest back giant turtle order explain turtle free fall another even bigger turtle posited resulting world turtle way despite shortcoming clashing modern physic due ontological extravagance theory seems metaphysically possible assuming space infinite one way ass viciousness regress distinguish local global explanation local explanation interested explaining one thing certain property reference another thing without trying explain thing well global explanation hand try explain thing property local explanation regress turtle theory benign succeeds explaining earth falling but global explanation fails assume rather explain step another thing falling explain nothing falling argued infinite regress benign certain circumstance despite aiming global explanation this line thought rest idea transmission involved vicious case explained somehow transmitted the problem transfer something posse first possession presumed rather explained for example assume trying explain neighbor property owner bag sugar revealed bag first someone else possession transferred neighbor true every previous owner this explanation unsatisfying since ownership presupposed every step non-transmissive explanation hand still reason also seen contingent fact this line thought used argue epistemic regress vicious from bayesian point view example justification evidence defined term one belief raising probability another belief true the former belief may also justified relevant explaining latter belief justified philosopher responded infinite regress argument various way the criticized theory defended example denying infinite regress involved infinitists hand embrace regress deny vicious another response modify theory order avoid regress this achieved form foundationalism coherentism
