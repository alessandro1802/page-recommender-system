information abstract concept refers power inform fundamental level information pertains interpretation may sensed any natural process completely random observable pattern medium said convey amount information whereas digital signal data use discrete sign convey information phenomenon artifact analog signal poem picture music sound current convey information continuous form information knowledge meaning may derived representation interpretation information often processed iteratively data available one step processed information interpreted processed next step for example written text symbol letter conveys information relevant word part word conveys information relevant phrase part phrase conveys information relevant sentence part final step information interpreted becomes knowledge given domain digital signal bit may interpreted symbol letter number structure convey information available next level the key characteristic information subject interpretation processing the concept information relevant various context including constraint communication control data form education knowledge meaning understanding mental stimulus pattern perception proposition representation entropy the derivation information signal message may thought resolution ambiguity uncertainty arises interpretation pattern within signal message information may structured data redundant data compressed optimal size theoretical limit compression the information available collection data may derived analysis for example data may collected single customer order restaurant the information available many order may analyzed becomes knowledge put use business subsequently able identify popular least popular dish information transmitted time via data storage space via communication telecommunication information expressed either content message direct indirect observation that perceived construed message right sense information always conveyed content message information encoded various form transmission interpretation example information may encoded sequence sign transmitted via signal also encrypted safe storage communication the uncertainty event measured probability occurrence uncertainty inversely proportional probability occurrence information theory take advantage concluding uncertain event require information resolve uncertainty the bit typical unit information 'that reduces uncertainty half other unit nat may used for example information encoded one fair coin flip bit two fair coin flip bit science article estimated technologically stored

process for example identifying outcome fair coin flip two equally likely outcome provides le information lower entropy specifying outcome roll die six equally likely outcome some important measure information theory mutual information channel capacity error exponent relative entropy important sub-fields information theory include source coding algorithmic complexity theory algorithmic information theory information-theoretic security there another opinion regarding universal definition information lie fact concept changed along change various historical epoch order find definition necessary find common feature pattern transformation for example researcher field information petrichenko semenova based retrospective analysis change concept information give following universal definition information form transmission human experience knowledge opinion change essence concept information occurs various breakthrough technology transfer experience knowledge i.e appearance

definition information according law dialectic negation-negation previous idea information contained filmed form modern representation application fundamental topic information theory include source coding/data compression e.g zip file channel coding/error detection correction e.g dsl it impact crucial success voyager mission deep space invention compact disc feasibility mobile phone development internet the theory also found application area including statistical inference cryptography neurobiology perception linguistics evolution function molecular code bioinformatics thermal physic quantum computing black hole information retrieval intelligence gathering plagiarism detection pattern recognition anomaly detection even art creation often information viewed type input organism system input two kind input important function organism example food system energy book sensory ecology biophysicist david dusenbery called causal input other input information important associated causal input used predict occurrence causal input later time perhaps another place some information important association information eventually must connection causal input practice information usually carried weak stimulus must detected specialized sensory system amplified energy input functional organism system for example light mainly e.g plant grow direction lightsource causal input plant animal provides information the colored light reflected flower weak photosynthesis visual system bee detects bee nervous system us information guide bee flower bee often find nectar pollen causal input serving nutritional function the cognitive scientist applied mathematician ronaldo vigo argues information concept requires least two related entity make quantitative sense these dimensionally defined category object subset essence representation word conveys representational hence conceptual information vigo defines amount information conveys rate change complexity whenever object removed under vigo information pattern invariance complexity representation information—five fundamental construct universal science—are unified novel mathematical framework among thing framework aim overcome limitation shannon-weaver information attempting characterize measure subjective information michael grief proposed focus information opposed defining grief proposed information substituted wasted physical resource time energy material goal oriented task goal oriented task divided two component cost efficient use physical resource time energy material additional use physical resource used task.this second category definition wasted physical resource information substitute replace cost efficient use physical resource used replace wasted physical resource the condition occurs cost information le cost wasted physical resource since information non-rival good especially beneficial repeatable task manufacturing task category cost efficient use physical resource called lean manufacturing information type pattern influence formation transformation pattern sense need conscious mind perceive much le appreciate pattern consider example dna the sequence nucleotide pattern influence formation development organism without need conscious mind one might argue though human consciously define pattern example nucleotide naturally involves conscious information processing system theory time seems refer information sense assuming information necessarily involve conscious mind pattern circulating due feedback system called information word said information sense something potentially perceived representation though created presented purpose for example gregory bateson defines information difference make difference however premise influence implies information perceived conscious mind also interpreted specific context associated interpretation may cause transformation information knowledge complex definition information knowledge make semantic logical analysis difficult condition transformation important point study information relates knowledge especially business discipline knowledge management practice tool process used assist knowledge worker performing research making decision including step stewart argues transformation information knowledge critical lying core value creation competitive advantage modern enterprise the danish dictionary
