apple device running io ios-based operating system jailbreaking use privilege escalation exploit remove software restriction imposed manufacturer typically done series kernel patch jailbroken device permit root access within operating system provides right install software available app store different device version exploited variety tool apple view jailbreaking violation end-user license agreement strongly caution device owner try achieve root access exploitation vulnerability while sometimes compared rooting android device jailbreaking bypassing several type apple prohibition end-user since includes modifying operating system enforced locked bootloader installing non-officially approved available app store application via sideloading granting user elevated administration-level privilege rooting concept io jailbreaking therefore technically different android device rooting one reason jailbreaking expand feature set limited apple app store apple check

involve privilege escalation differ scope where android rooting jailbreaking similar used grant owner device superuser system-level privilege may transferred one apps however unlike io phone tablet nearly android device already offer option allow user sideload apps onto device without install official source google play store many android device also provide owner capability modify even replace full operating system unlocking bootloader however requires factory reset contrast io device engineered restriction including locked bootloader unlocked owner modify operating system without violating apple end-user license agreement and io corporation could install private application onto corporate phone sideloading unsanctioned apps onto io device source app store prohibited individual user without purchased developer membership after ability install apps became free user however requires basic understanding xcode compiling io apps jailbreaking io device defeat security restriction
