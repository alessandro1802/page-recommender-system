In the meanwhile he received his PhD from Sheffield University. His doctoral dissertation was published as Book Availability and the Library User (Pergamon, 1975).  In 1972 he moved to the United States to Purdue University Libraries, where he was assistant director of libraries for Technical Services, before becoming dean of the School of Library and Information Studies at Berkeley, 1976–84.
