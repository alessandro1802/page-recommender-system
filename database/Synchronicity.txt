synchronicity german synchronizität concept first introduced analytical psychologist carl jung describe circumstance appear meaningfully related yet lack causal connection contemporary research synchronicity experience refer one subjective experience coincidence event one mind outside world may causally unrelated yet unknown connection jung held healthy even necessary function human mind

coincidence also taken new age movement unlike magical thinking belief causally unrelated event paranormal causal connection synchronicity principle supposes event may truly causally unrelated yet unknown noncausal connection the objection scientific standpoint however neither testable falsifiable therefore fall within realm empirical study scientific scepticism regard pseudoscience jung stated

could found diffused throughout chinese philosophy broadly various taoist concept jung also drew heavily german philosopher gottfried leibniz whose exposure ching divination century proved major step towards theory synchronicity arthur schopenhauer jung placed alongside leibniz two philosopher influential formulation concept johannes kepler point schopenhauer especially providing early conception synchronicity quote all event man life would accordingly stand two fundamentally different kind connection firstly objective causal connection natural process secondly subjective connection exists

originating work german religious scholar rudolf otto describes feeling gravitas found religious experience perhaps brought greatest criticism upon jung theory jung also drew parapsychologist rhine

proclivity towards mind–body dualism analytical psychology considers modern mode thought rest upon pre-modern primordial structure psyche causal connection thus form basis modern worldviews connection lack causal reasoning seen chance this chance-based interpretation however incongruent primordial mind instead interprets category intention the primordial framework fact place emphasis connection modern framework emphasizes causal one regard causality like synchronicity human interpretation imposed onto external phenomenon primordial mode thought however according jung necessary constituent
