cosmological argument also sometimes referred argument universal causation argument first cause causal argument prime mover argument whichever term employed two basic variant argument subtle yet

following aristotle claiming must something explain universe exists since universe could different circumstance conceivably exist contingency existence must cause merely another contingent thing something exists necessity something must exist order anything else exist word even universe always existed still owes existence uncaused cause aquinas said ... understand god aquinas argument contingency allows possibility universe beginning time form argument universal causation aquinas observed nature thing contingent existence since possible thing exist must time thing fact exist thus according aquinas must time nothing existed would exist nothing could bring anything existence contingent being therefore insufficient account existence contingent being must exist necessary whose non-existence impossibility existence contingent being ultimately derived the german philosopher gottfried leibniz made similar argument principle sufficient reason there found fact true existent true

limited enormous power omnipotence creator heaven earth god according christian understanding god eternal absolutely self-sufficient since attribute unique god anything attribute must god something attribute cause hence cause god cause exists hence god exists craig defends second premise universe beginning starting al-ghazali proof actual infinity impossible however universe never beginning would actual infinite craig claim namely infinite amount cause effect event hence universe beginning dun scotus influential medieval christian theologian created metaphysical argument existence god though inspired aquinas argument motion like philosopher theologian believed statement god existence could considered separate aquinas his explanation god existence long summarised follows scotus deal immediately two objection see first first second argument fall apart questioned state infinite regress impossible provokes unanswerable question like modern english what infinity minus infinity the second state answered question rephrased using modal logic meaning first statement instead possible something produced depending formulation cosmological argument example positive infinite regress argument infinite regress infinite series entity governed recursive principle determines entity series depends produced predecessor infinite regress argument argument theory based fact theory lead infinite regress positive infinite regress argument employ regress question argue support theory showing alternative involves vicious regress the regress relevant cosmological argument regress cause event occurred caused another event occurred caused previous event for infinite regress argument successful demonstrate theory question entail infinite regress also regress vicious once viciousness regress cause established cosmological argument proceed positive conclusion holding necessary posit first cause order avoid regress vicious due metaphysical impossibility implausibility explanatory failure sometimes held regress cause vicious metaphysically impossible i.e involves outright contradiction but difficult see contradiction lie unless additional assumption accepted actual infinity impossible but position opposed infinity general specifically regress cause promising view regress cause rejected implausible such argument based empirical observation e.g best knowledge universe beginning form big bang but also based abstract principle like ockham razor posit avoid ontological extravagance multiplying entity without necessity third option see regress cause vicious due explanatory failure i.e solve problem formulated solve assumes already disguised form supposed explain according position seek explain one event present citing earlier event caused but explanation incomplete unless come understand earlier event occurred explained cause step occurrence event assumed fails explain anything occurs chain cause begin one objection argument leaf open question first cause unique require cause proponent argue first cause exempt cause opponent argue special pleading otherwise untrue critic often press arguing first cause exemption raise question first cause indeed exempt whereas defender maintain question answered various argument emphasizing none major form rest premise everything cause william lane craig popularised notable defending kalam cosmological argument argues infinite impossible whichever perspective viewer take must always one unmoved thing begin universe us hilbert paradox grand hotel question what infinity minus infinity illustrate idea infinite metaphysically mathematically even conceptually impossible other reason include fact impossible count infinity universe existed infinite amount time every possible event including final end universe would already occurred therefore state argument three point firstly everything begin exist cause existence secondly universe began exist thirdly therefore universe cause existence craig argues blackwell companion natural theology infinite regress cause thus must first uncaused cause even one posit plurality cause universe argues occam razor may employed remove unneeded cause universe leave single uncaused cause secondly argued premise causality arrived via posteriori inductive reasoning dependent experience david hume highlighted problem induction argued causal relation true priori however whether inductive deductive reasoning valuable remains matter debate general conclusion neither prominent opponent argument tend argue unwise draw conclusion extrapolation causality beyond experience andrew loke reply according kalam cosmological argument thing begin exist require cause hand something without beginning always existed therefore require cause the kalam thomistic cosmological argument posit actual infinite regress cause therefore must uncaused first cause beginningless require cause according objection basic cosmological argument merely establishes first cause exists attribute theistic god omniscience omnipotence omnibenevolence this argument often expanded assert least attribute necessarily true instance modern kalam argument given causal loop form predestination paradox arising traveling backwards time deemed possibility sufficiently powerful entity world would capacity travel backwards time point existence create thereby initiating everything follows the usual reason given refute possibility causal loop requires loop whole cause richard hanley argues causal loop logically physically epistemically impossible timed system possibly objectionable feature causal loop share coincidence required explain however andrew loke argues causal loop type supposed avoid first cause suffers problem vicious circularity thus would work david hume later paul edward invoked similar principle criticism cosmological argument william rowe called hume-edwards principle existence every member set explained existence set thereby explained nevertheless david white argues notion infinite causal regress providing proper explanation fallacious furthermore hume dialogue concerning natural religion character demea state even succession cause infinite whole chain still requires cause explain suppose exists causal chain infinite contingent being one asks question why contingent being help told there contingent being contingent being caused that answer would presuppose additional contingent being adequate explanation contingent being exist would invoke different sort necessary contingent response might suppose individual contingent
