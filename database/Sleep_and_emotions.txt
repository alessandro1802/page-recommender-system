emotion play key role overall mental health sleep play crucial role maintaining optimal homeostasis emotional functioning deficient sleep form sleep deprivation restriction adversely impact emotion generation emotion regulation emotional expression scientist offer two explanation effect sleep loss emotion one explanation sleep loss cause disinhibition emotional brain region leading overall increase emotional intensity also referred dysregulation model the explanation describes sleep loss cause increase fatigue sleepiness coupled overall decrease energy arousal leading overall decrease emotional intensity also referred fatigue model the dysregulation model supported neuroanatomical physiological subjective self-report study emotional brain region e.g amygdala shown greater reactivity emotionally negative photograph following one night sleep deprivation measured functional magnetic resonance imaging five day sleep restriction four hour sleep opportunity per night caused decrease connectivity cortical brain region involved regulation amygdala pupil diameter shown increase significantly response negative photograph following sleep deprivation when exposed positive stimulus sleep deprived participant showed amplified emotional reactivity throughout various midbrain striatal limbic visual processing brain region one night sleep deprivation caused participant judge neutral image negatively non sleep deprived participant one night sleep loss also caused increased impulsivity negative stimulus the fatigue-model supported subjective self-report physiological study arousal measured electroencephalograph eeg decrease sleep loss increase leading decrease desire perform exert effort short-term sleep loss associated blunting recognition negative positive facial expression various form emotional expression including facial vocal expression adversely affected sleep loss following one night sleep deprivation participant show decreased facial expressiveness response positive stimulus well decreased vocal expression positive emotion sleep deprivation slows generation facial reaction response emotional face one two night sleep loss healthy adult associated decrease generated intensity positive mood i.e happiness activation well increase generated intensity negative mood i.e anger depression fear fatigue long-term chronic exposure insufficient sleep associated decline optimism sociability increase subjective experience sleepiness fatigue furthermore sleep restricted five hour night course week cause significant increase self-reports subjective mood disturbance sleepiness deficient sleep pattern prominent many psychiatric ailment insomnia increase risk depressive episode sleep deprivation influence onset hypomania sleep disturbance contributes maintenance mood disorder amongst manic bipolar patient sleep loss may act trigger onset manic episode sleep pattern affected behavioral emotional disorder aspect emotional cognitive well-being influenced sleep pattern scientist examined effect deficient sleep pattern emotion regulation individual diagnosed mental disorder e.g depression anxiety borderline personality disorder bipolar disorder panic disorder method typically include observational subjective behavioral physiological measure emotional functioning emotion regulation difficulty associated greater symptom depression anxiety borderline personality worsen poor sleep pattern heart rate variability hrv described time interval heartbeat linked emotion regulation capacity higher resting hrv associated greater emotion regulation capacity lower resting hrv associated low emotion regulation capacity physiological data suggests hrv negatively affected sleep loss seen panic disorder patient poor sleep quality display increased cognitive inhibition due reduced hrv emotion dysregulation also shown play role maintenance generalized anxiety disorder panic disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder posttraumatic stress disorder overall deficient sleep play role dampening emotion clinical population already susceptible emotion dysregulation well maintaining various psychiatric condition contributing emotion dysfunction several important emotional characteristic develop childhood linked sleep quality duration example approachability adaptability attachment sleep disruption argued play role cry frequency cry interpreted early form behavioral dysregulation therefore linked emotion regulation hypothesized dreaming might way improving mood non-clinical population the evidence phenomenon collected home dream report psychotherapy laboratory dream collected waking participant rem sleep phase adult often remember dream negative emotional component whereby woman recall dream men dream recall associated higher level anxiety lighter sleep study conducted depressed healthy adult able show healthy subject dreaming way positively influence mood cope stress night dream depressed person however might deteriorate mood this study interesting result limited generalizability due small sample lack reported dream depressed patient emotion apparent stage rem-sleep rather stage sleep found rem-sleep negative emotion diminish after going stage rem-sleep people depression report feeling better study done cartwright conversely theory proposed revonsuo state people experience negative emotion negative event sleep rem-sleep replay event known rehearsal during rem-sleep area brain suborbital area cortical area responsible emotion also suppression arousing emotion activated scientist noticed decrease hormone noradrenaline released body highly stimulating event people reported trouble falling asleep sleeping consistently throughout night stressful event happening life observed Ã¥kerstedt rem-sleep aid people negative emotion high stress the circadian rhythm provides person signal sleep wake circadian rhythm sleep-wake cycle misaligned might lead negative affect emotional instability found emotion vary depending circadian rhythm duration long one awake circadian sleep-rhythm disorder like shift-work disorder jetlag-disorder found similarly contribute dysregulation affect symptom like irritability anxiety apathy dysphoria
