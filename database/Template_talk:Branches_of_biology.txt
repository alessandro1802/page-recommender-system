I think the subfield "taxonomy" should link to alpha taxonomy, not taxonomy. The article "taxonomy" is about classifying things (anything), not the biological meaning of classifying living organisms (which corresponds to the article "alpha taxonomy", as explained by both articles). I just wanted to make sure that everyone is ok with the change before doing it.

One can definitely question the wisdom of placing 15 navboxes on a page (not my doing), but regardless of how many there are, it just looks bad to have some automatically showing (no matter how small they are) and some automatically hidden. Users who would maintain this as an unhidable box (and use somewhat insulting language in their edit summaries)[1] need to be willing to explain why this box is more worthy of eternal sunshine than all the other navboxes created with the standard template. Note that you can use a piped command with this template ("state=uncollapsed") on individual pages to prevent autocollapse.-RustavoTalk/Contribs 22:25, 23 May 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Hi! I am missing some kind of proof or reference in this template. How can be determined if certain field of biology is a major subfield. I think Astrobiology, Biochemistry or Bioinformatics has clearly interdisciplinary character. Are they -major- subfields? I don think so. I have also doubts about the Origin of life subfield. --Gbaor 21:29, 20 September 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I have noticed that almost all items in the box are sorted alphabetically, with only a couple of exceptions. Is there any specific reason why these exceptions have been made or is it just a mistake that ought to be corrected? Waltham, The Duke of 16:11, 6 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply]
