april captain ray bowyer flying routine passenger flight civilian airline company aurigny air service passenger gained progressively clearer view two ufo period bowyer year flying experience flight one completed every working day year their journey minute took southampton southern coast england southwestward alderney mile kilometre france northernmost channel island their particular flight path converging two enormous seemingly stationary identical airborne craft emanated brilliant yellow light pilot plane near sark south confirmed presence general position altitude first object opposite direction radar trace also seemed register presence two object ray bowyer believed correlated position time sighting study david clarke however could establish definite link radar reflection cargo passenger ferry may affected least reading bowyer disagreed clarke team supposed link radar trace ferry proposed two solid airborne craft could manufactured earth working unison day suggested evidence
