Apache Sling is an open source Web framework for the Java platform designed to create content-centric applications on top of a  JSR-170-compliant (a.k.a. JCR) content repository such as Apache Jackrabbit.[2] Apache Sling allows developers to deploy their application components as OSGi bundles or as scripts and templates in the content repository. Supported scripting languages are JSP, server-side JavaScript, Ruby, Velocity. The goal of Apache Sling is to expose content in the content repository as HTTP resources, fostering a RESTful style of application architecture. Sling is different from many other Web application frameworks in the sense that it truly focuses on the web aspect of the "web application" development and  through its development paradigm suggests an intuitive RESTful  development of a true web application. Other frameworks focus more on the application development and therefore are ideal extensions to Sling.[3] The Sling project was started on August 27, 2007,[4] when Day Software proposed to donate the source base of its internal web framework powering the Day Communiqu√© WCM to the Apache Software Foundation. The project was accepted to the Apache Incubator with Apache Jackrabbit being the sponsoring project.  On June 18, 2009 [5] the project graduated as an Apache top-level project.
