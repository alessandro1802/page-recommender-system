WWE Main Event is an American professional wrestling television program produced by WWE. Premiering on October 3, 2012, the hour-long program features mid-card talent from WWE's Raw brand.  Main Event is taped on Monday nights prior to WWE Raw. In the United States, Main Event streams new episodes on Hulu on Thursdays; it was initially carried by Ion Television as well until April 2014. It is also carried by WWE's international television partners.  The series first aired in the United States on Ion Television, originally premiering October 3, 2012 and airing on Wednesday nights. WWE considered the show to be a spiritual replacement for WWE Superstars (which previously aired on WGN America until 2011, and transitioned to WWE's digital platforms in the U.S. afterward). Hulu acquired rights to the series as well, as part of a larger pact that included video on-demand rights for WWE's main weekly programs.[1][2] Ion Television dropped the series in April 2014; following the cancellation, WWE streamed a live episode of Main Event from Detroit on its then-new subscription service WWE Network. It was reported to be a stress test for live events on the service in preparation for WrestleMania XXX.[3] Main Event was initially positioned as a non-branded show, featuring performers from both the Raw and SmackDown rosters.[2]  Following the 2016 WWE Draft, the program became exclusive to SmackDown. After the cancellation of WWE Superstars, Main Event became exclusive to Raw. Prior to November 28, 2016, Main Event was taped prior to SmackDown. It was then moved to Raw after the premiere of WWE Network's 205 Live, which was broadcast live after SmackDown from the same venue.[4] WWE commentators Kevin Patrick and Byron Saxton are the broadcast team, while Mike Rome is the ring announcer. From October 3, 2012, to January 22, 2014, "Diamond Eyes (Boom-Lay Boom-Lay Boom)" by Shinedown served as the official theme for Main Event.
