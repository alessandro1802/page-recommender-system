mathematical logic universal quantification type quantifier logical constant interpreted given express predicate satisfied every member domain discourse word predication property relation every member domain asserts predicate within scope universal quantifier true every value predicate variable usually denoted turned logical operator symbol used together predicate variable called universal quantifier sometimes alone universal quantification distinct existential quantification exists asserts property relation hold least one member domain quantification general covered article quantification logic the universal quantifier encoded for all unicode \forall latex related formula editor suppose given etc.this would seem logical conjunction repeated use however etc interpreted conjunction formal logic instead statement must rephrased for natural number one n.this single statement using universal quantification this statement said precise original one while etc informally includes natural number nothing rigorously given universal quantification hand natural number mentioned explicitly this particular example true natural number could substituted statement would true contrast for natural number one ni false substituted instance statement false immaterial true natural number even existence single counterexample enough prove universal quantification false hand composite number one true none counterexample composite number this indicates importance domain discourse specifies value take note particular note domain discourse restricted consist object satisfy certain predicate universal quantification requires logical conditional for example for composite number one ni logically equivalent for natural number composite n.here ... construction indicates logical conditional symbolic logic universal quantifier symbol \displaystyle \forall turned sans-serif font unicode used indicate universal quantification first used way gerhard gentzen analogy giuseppe peano \displaystyle \exists turned notation existential quantification later use peano notation bertrand russell for example predicate set natural number false statement similarly predicate composite true statement several variation notation quantification apply form found quantifier article the negation universally quantified function obtained changing universal quantifier existential quantifier negating quantified formula that \displaystyle \lnot denotes negation for example propositional function married set living human being universal quantification given living person person marriedis written this statement false truthfully stated case given living person person marriedor symbolically function true every element must least one element statement false that negation \displaystyle \forall x\in logically equivalent there exists living person married erroneous confuse person married i.e exists person married person married i.e exists person married the universal existential quantifier move unchanged across logical connective long operand affected conversely logical connective quantifier flip rule inference rule justifying logical step hypothesis conclusion there several rule inference utilize universal quantifier universal instantiation concludes propositional function known universally true must true arbitrary element universe discourse symbolically represented completely arbitrary element universe discourse universal generalization concludes propositional function must universally true true arbitrary element universe discourse symbolically arbitrary the element must completely arbitrary else logic follow arbitrary instead specific element universe discourse implies existential quantification propositional function convention formula \displaystyle \forall \in \emptyset always true regardless formula see vacuous truth the universal closure formula formula free variable obtained adding universal quantifier every free variable for
