The Berlin/Brandenburg metropolitan region (German: Metropolregion Berlin-Brandenburg) or capital region (German: Hauptstadtregion Berlin-Brandenburg) is one of eleven metropolitan regions of Germany, consisting of the entire territories of the state of Berlin and the surrounding state of Brandenburg. The region covers an area of 30,545 square kilometres (11,793 sq mi) with a total population of about 6.2 million.[3][4] The metropolitan region should be distinguished from Berlin's immediate agglomeration, dubbed Berliner Umland (English: Berlin's surrounding countryside or Berlin's countryside) which comprises the city and the nearby Brandenburg municipalities. Berliner Umland is significantly smaller and much more densely populated than the metropolitan region, accounting for the vast majority of the region's population over a fraction of its total land area. Within the metropolitan region, there is a much smaller and much more densely populated area called Berliner Umland (English: Berlin's surrounding countryside or Berlin's countryside), which comprises the city of Berlin and the immediate Brandenburg municipalities surrounding it. With over 4.46 million people living in its 3,743 km2 area, Berliner Umland accounts for the vast majority (approximately 74%) of the population of the entire metropolitan region over approximately 12% of the entire area.[5]  The region contains five independent cities – of which the Brandenburg capital Potsdam is the only one with a population greater than 100,000 – and 14 districts (Landkreise). The inhabitants of Berlin and Potsdam account for more than 80 percent of the region's total population. The Brandenburg area is characterized by suburban settlements on the Berlin city limits and small towns in the rural outer area. Beside Berlin and Potsdam, Berliner Umland comprises the following 67 municipalities:[6] These other communes are listed below, subdivided per district.
