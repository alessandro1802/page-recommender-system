mathematics equality relationship two quantity generally two mathematical expression asserting quantity value expression represent mathematical object the equality written pronounced equal the symbol called equal sign two object equal said distinct for example the etymology word latin aequālis equal like comparable similar aequus equal level fair some specific example these last three property make equality equivalence relation they originally included among peano axiom natural number although symmetric transitive property often seen fundamental deduced substitution reflexive property when fully specified depend variable equality proposition may true value false value equality binary relation i.e. two-argument predicate may produce truth value false true argument computer programming computation two expression known comparison when may viewed function variable mean define function such equality function sometimes called identity example \displaystyle \left \left =x^ sometimes always identity written triple bar \displaystyle \left \left \equiv equation problem finding value variable called unknown specified equality true the term equation may also refer equality relation satisfied value variable one interested for example \displaystyle +y^ equation unit circle there standard notation distinguishes equation identity use equality relation one guess appropriate interpretation semantics expression context identity asserted true value variable given domain equation may sometimes mean identity often specifies subset variable space subset equation true there logic system notion equality this reflects undecidability equality two real number defined formula involving integer basic arithmetic operation logarithm exponential function word exist algorithm deciding equality the binary relation approximately equal denoted symbol \displaystyle \approx real number thing even precisely defined transitive since many small difference add something big however equality almost everywhere transitive questionable equality test may denoted using symbol viewed relation equality archetype general concept equivalence relation set binary relation reflexive symmetric transitive the identity relation equivalence relation conversely let equivalence relation let denote equivalence class consisting element then relation equivalent equality follows equality finest equivalence relation set sense relation smallest equivalence class every class reduced single element context equality sharply distinguished equivalence isomorphism for example one may distinguish fraction rational number latter equivalence class fraction fraction \displaystyle \displaystyle distinct fraction different string symbol represent rational number point number line this distinction give rise notion quotient set similarly set equal set first consists letter second consists number set three element thus isomorphic meaning bijection for example however choice isomorphism set identified without making choice statement identifies depends choice identification this distinction equality isomorphism fundamental importance category theory one motivation development category theory case one may consider equal two mathematical object equivalent property structure considered the word congruence associated symbol \displaystyle \cong frequently used kind equality defined quotient set isomorphism class object geometry instance two geometric shape said equal congruent one may moved coincide equality/congruence relation isomorphism class isometry shape similarly isomorphism set difference isomorphism equality/congruence mathematical object property structure one motivation development category theory well homotopy type theory univalent foundation leibniz characterized notion equality follows equality set axiomatized set theory two different way depending whether axiom based first-order language without equality first-order logic equality axiom extensionality state two set contain element set incorporating half work first-order logic may regarded mere matter convenience noted lévy first-order logic without equality two set defined equal contain element then axiom extensionality state two equal set contained set
