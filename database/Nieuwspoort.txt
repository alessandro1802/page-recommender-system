The Nieuwspoort (English: News gate) is a society catering to Dutch politicians, lobbyists and journalists so they can informally meet.[1] It's also a place where press conferences from politicians (most notably the Prime Minister of the Netherlands' weekly address)[2] are held. The press centre was opened in 1962 by Jo Cals.[2] Many notable incidents took place here, including the pieing incident during the book release of Pim Fortuyn's De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars and Ayaan Hirsi Ali's retirement announcement.[2]  This article about an organisation in the Netherlands is a stub.
