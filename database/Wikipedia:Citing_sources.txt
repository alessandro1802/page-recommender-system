necessarily identical string the new york time time different access-dates significant discourage editor particularly inexperienced one adding duplicate citation use source appropriate duplicate better citation but editor feel free combine best practice wikipedia citation different page part source also combined preserving distinct part citation described previous section any method consistent existing citation style may used consensus sought change existing style finding duplicate citation examining reference list difficult there tool help some wikipedia article use short

noted what information include helpful include hyperlink source material available here note issue concerning link embedded link external website used form inline citation highly susceptible linkrot wikipedia allowed early years—for example adding link sentence like http rendered this longer recommended raw link recommended lieu properly written citation even placed ref tag like ref http /ref

inline citation allow reader editor see material supported citation point lost citation clearly placed the distance material source matter editorial judgment adding text without clearly placing source may lead allegation original research violation sourcing policy even plagiarism editor exercise caution rearranging inserting material ensure text–source relationship maintained reference need moved solely maintain chronological order footnote appear article moved might break text–source relationship sentence paragraph footnoted source adding new material supported existing source sentence/paragraph without source new text highly misleading placed appear cited source support when new text inserted paragraph make sure supported existing new source for example editing text originally reading the sun pretty big note edit imply new material supported reference the sun pretty big the sun also quite hot note add fact assertion fully cited paragraph sentence the sun pretty big moon big the sun also quite hot note include source support new information there several way write including the sun pretty big moon big the sun also quite hot note sometimes article readable multiple citation bundled single footnote for example multiple source given sentence source applies entire sentence source placed end sentence like bundled one footnote end sentence paragraph like bundling also useful source support different portion preceding text source support text bundling several advantage concatenate multiple citation content semicolon another character appropriate article style used alternatively use one template listed disambiguation page template multiple reference the sun pretty big bright hot note for multiple citation single footnote reference specific statement several layout available illustrated within given article single layout used the sun pretty big moon big the sun also quite hot note however using line break separate list item breach accessibility nobreaks separate list item line break unbulleted list citebundle made specifically purpose also available unbulleted list in-text attribution attribution inside sentence material source addition inline citation sentence in-text attribution used direct speech source word quotation mark block quotation indirect speech source word modified without quotation mark close paraphrasing also used loosely summarizing source position word always used biased statement opinion avoids inadvertent plagiarism help reader see position coming inline citation follow attribution usually end sentence paragraph question for example reach fair decision party must consider matter behind veil ignorance john rawls argues reach fair decision party must consider matter behind veil ignorance john rawls argues reach fair decision party must consider matter situated behind veil ignorance when using in-text attribution make sure n't lead inadvertent neutrality violation for example following implies parity source without making clear position darwin majority view charles darwin say human being evolved natural selection john smith writes arrived pod mars.y human evolved natural selection first explained charles darwin the descent man selection relation sex.neutrality issue apart way in-text attribution mislead the sentence suggests the new york time alone made important discovery according
