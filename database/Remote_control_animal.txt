remote control animal animal controlled remotely human some application require electrode implanted animal nervous system connected receiver usually carried animal back the animal controlled use radio signal the electrode move animal directly controlling robot rather signal direction action desired human operator stimulate animal reward centre animal complies these sometimes called bio-robots robo-animals they considered cyborg combine electronic device organic life form hence sometimes also called cyborg-animals cyborg-insects because surgery required moral ethical issue involved
