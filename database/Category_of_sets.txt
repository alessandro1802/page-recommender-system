mathematical field category theory category set denoted set category whose object set the arrow morphisms set total function composition morphisms composition function many category category group group homomorphism arrow add structure object category set and/or restrict arrow function particular kind the axiom category satisfied set composition function associative every set identity function idx serf identity element function composition the epimorphisms set surjective map monomorphisms injective map isomorphism bijective map the empty set serf initial object set empty function morphisms every singleton terminal object function mapping element source set single target element morphisms there thus zero object set the category set complete co-complete the product category given cartesian product set the coproduct given disjoint union given set range index set construct coproduct union ai× cartesian product serf ensure component stay disjoint set prototype concrete category category concrete built set well-defined way every two-element set serf subobject classifier set the power object set given power set exponential object set given set function set thus topos particular cartesian closed exact sense barr set abelian additive preadditive every non-empty set injective object set every set projective object set assuming axiom choice the finitely presentable object set finite set since every set direct limit finite subset category set locally finitely presentable category arbitrary category contravariant functors set often important object study object functor set sends homc set morphisms example functor small category i.e collection object form set contravariant functors set together natural transformation morphisms form new category functor category known category presheaves zermelo–fraenkel set theory collection set set follows axiom foundation one refers collection set proper class one handle proper class one handle set particular one write proper class belong collection either set proper class this problem mean category set formalized straightforwardly setting category like set whose collection object form proper class known large category distinguish small category whose object form set one way resolve problem work system give formal status proper class nbg set theory setting category formed set said small like set formed proper class said large another solution assume existence grothendieck universe roughly speaking grothendieck universe set model instance set belongs universe element powerset belong universe the existence grothendieck universe empty set set \displaystyle \omega hereditarily finite set implied usual axiom additional independent axiom roughly equivalent existence strongly inaccessible cardinal assuming extra axiom one limit object set element particular universe there set set within model one still reason class inner set i.e. element one variation scheme class set union entire tower grothendieck universe this necessarily proper class grothendieck universe set element larger grothendieck universe however one work directly category set instead theorem expressed term category setu whose object element sufficiently large grothendieck universe shown depend particular choice foundation category theory approach well matched system like tarski–grothendieck set theory one reason directly proper class principal disadvantage theorem true setu set various solution variation proposed the issue arise concrete category category group category topological space
