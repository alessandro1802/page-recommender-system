social psychology group polarization refers tendency group make decision extreme initial inclination member these extreme decision towards greater risk individual initial tendency risky towards greater caution individual initial tendency cautious the phenomenon also hold group attitude toward situation may change sense individual initial attitude strengthened intensified group discussion phenomenon known attitude polarization group polarization important phenomenon social psychology observable many social context for example group woman hold moderately feminist view tend demonstrate heightened pro-feminist belief following group discussion similarly study shown deliberating together mock jury member often decided punitive damage award either larger smaller amount individual juror favored prior deliberation the study indicated juror favored relatively low award discussion would lead even lenient result jury inclined impose stiff penalty discussion would make even harsher moreover recent year internet online social medium also presented opportunity observe group polarization compile new research psychologist found social medium outlet facebook twitter demonstrate group polarization occur even group physically together long group individual begin fundamental opinion topic consistent dialogue kept going group polarization occur research suggested well-established group suffer le polarization group discussing problem well known however situation group somewhat newly formed task new group polarization demonstrate profound influence decision-making attitude polarization also known belief polarization polarization effect phenomenon disagreement becomes extreme different party consider evidence issue one effect confirmation bias tendency people search interpret evidence selectively reinforce current belief attitude when people encounter ambiguous evidence bias potentially result interpreting support existing attitude widening rather narrowing disagreement the effect observed issue activate emotion political hot-button issue for issue new evidence produce polarization effect for issue polarization found mere thinking issue without contemplating new evidence produce effect social comparison process also invoked explanation effect increased setting people repeat validate statement this apparent tendency interest psychologist also sociologist philosopher since late psychologist carried number study various aspect attitude polarization charles lord lee ross mark lepper performed study selected two group people one group strongly favor capital punishment strongly opposed the researcher initially measured strength people held position later pro- anti-capital punishment people put small group shown one two card containing statement result research project written for example krone phillips compared murder rate year year adoption capital punishment state state murder rate lower adoption death penalty this research support deterrent effect death penalty palmer crandall compared murder rate pair neighboring state different capital punishment law pair murder rate higher state capital punishment this research opposes deterrent effect death penalty the researcher asked people strength belief deterrence effect death penalty time also asked effect research attitude next stage research participant given information study described card received including detail research critique research researcher response critique the participant degree commitment original position re-measured participant asked quality research effect research belief finally trial rerun participant using card supported opposite position initially seen the researcher found people tended believe research supported original view better conducted convincing research n't whichever position held initially people tended hold position strongly reading research supported lord point reasonable people le critical research support current position seems le rational people significantly increase strength attitude read supporting evidence when people read research supported view research tended hold original attitude strongly received information these result understood context several problem implementation study including fact researcher changed scaling outcome variable measuring attitude change impossible measured polarization using subjective assessment attitude change direct measure much change occurred group polarization choice shift similar many way however differ one distinct way group polarization refers attitude change individual level due influence group choice shift refers outcome attitude change namely difference average group member pre-group discussion attitude outcome group decision risky cautious shift part generalized idea known group-induced attitude polarization though group polarization deal mainly risk-involving decision and/or opinion discussion-induced shift shown occur several non-risk-involving level this suggests general phenomenon choice-shifts exists apart risk-related decision clarification needed stoner found decision impacted value behind circumstance decision the study found situation normally favor risky alternative increased risky shift more situation normally favor cautious alternative increased cautious shift these finding also show importance previous group shift choice shift mainly explained largely differing human value highly value held individual according moscovici interaction within group difference opinion necessary group polarization take place while extremist group may sway opinion shift occur sufficient proper interaction within group word extremist impact without interaction also moscovici found individual preference irrelevant difference opinion cause shift this finding demonstrates one opinion group sway group combination individual opinion make impact the study group polarization traced back unpublished master thesis mit student james stoner observed so-called risky shift the concept risky shift maintains group decision riskier average individual decision member group met early study risky-shift phenomenon measured using scale known choice-dilemmas questionnaire this measure required participant consider hypothetical scenario individual faced dilemma must make choice resolve issue hand participant asked estimate probability certain choice would benefit risk individual discussed consider following example mr. electrical engineer married one child working large electronics corporation since graduating college five year ago assured lifetime job modest though adequate salary liberal pension benefit upon retirement hand unlikely salary increase much retires while attending convention mr. offered job small newly founded company highly uncertain future the new job would pay start would offer possibility share owner- ship company survived competition larger firm participant asked imagine advising mr. they would provided series probability indicate whether new company offered position financially stable would read following please check lowest probability would consider acceptable make worthwhile mr. take new job ____the chance company prove financially sound ____the chance company prove financially sound ____the chance company prove financially sound ____the chance company prove financially sound ____the chance company prove financially sound ____place check think mr. take new job matter probability individual completed questionnaire made decision independently others later would asked join group reassess choice indicated shift mean value initial study using method revealed group decision tended relatively riskier made individual this tendency also occurred individual judgment collected group discussion even individual post-discussion measure delayed two six week the discovery risky shift considered surprising counter-intuitive especially since earlier work allport researcher suggested individual made extreme decision group leading expectation group would make decision would conform average risk level member the seemingly counter-intuitive finding stoner led spurt research around risky shift originally thought special case exception standard decision-making practice many people concluded people group setting would make decision based assumed overall risk level group stoner work necessarily address specific theme seem contrast stoner initial definition risky shift additional controversy arose leading researcher examine topic late however become clear risky shift one type many attitude became extreme group leading moscovici zavalloni term overall phenomenon group polarization subsequently decade-long period examination applicability group polarization number field lab field setting began there substantial amount empirical evidence demonstrating phenomenon group polarization group polarization widely considered fundamental group decision-making process well established remained non-obvious puzzling mechanism fully understood almost soon phenomenon group polarization discovered number theory offered help explain account these explanation gradually narrowed grouped together two primary mechanism remained social comparison informational influence the social comparison theory normative influence theory widely used explain group polarization according social comparison interpretation group polarization occurs result individual desire gain acceptance perceived favorable way group the theory hold people first compare idea held rest group observe evaluate group value prefers order gain acceptance people take position similar everyone else slightly extreme individual support group belief still presenting admirable group leader the presence member extreme viewpoint attitude polarize group study regarding theory demonstrated normative influence likely judgmental issue group goal harmony person-oriented group member public response informational influence persuasive argument theory also used explain group polarization recognized psychologist today the persuasive argument interpretation hold individual become convinced view hear novel argument support position the theory posit group member enters discussion aware set item information argument favoring side issue lean toward side boast greater amount information word individual base individual choice weighing remembered pro con argument some item argument shared among member item unshared one member considered argument assuming group member lean direction discussion item unshared information supporting direction expressed provides member previously unaware reason lean direction group discussion shift weight evidence group member express argument shedding light onto number different position idea research indicated informational influence likely intellective issue group goal making correct decision task-oriented group member private response furthermore research suggests simply sharing information predicts group polarization rather amount information persuasiveness argument mediate level polarization experienced significant argument occurred whether persuasive argumentation alone accounted group polarization daniel isenberg meta-analysis data gathered persuasive argument social comparison camp succeeded large part answering question predominant mechanism isenberg concluded substantial evidence effect operating simultaneously persuasive argument theory operated social comparison vice versa while two theory widely accepted explanation group polarization alternative theory proposed the popular theory self-categorization theory self-categorization theory stem social identity theory hold conformity stem psychological process member group defined subjective perception self member specific category accordingly proponent self-categorization model hold group polarization occurs individual identify particular group conform prototypical group position extreme group mean contrast social comparison theory persuasive argumentation theory self-categorization model maintains inter-group categorization process cause group polarization support self-categorization theory explains group polarization conformity polarized norm found hogg turner davidson experiment participant gave pre-test post-test group consensus recommendation three choice dilemma item-types risky neutral cautious the researcher hypothesized ingroup confronted risky outgroup polarize toward caution ingroup confronted caution outgroup polarize toward risk ingroup middle social frame reference confronted risky cautious outgroups polarize converge pre-test mean the result study supported hypothesis participant converged norm polarized toward risk risky item toward caution cautious item another similar study found in-group prototype become polarized group becomes extreme social context this lends support self-categorization explanation group polarization the rising popularity increased number online social medium platform facebook twitter instagram enabled people seek share idea others similar interest common value making group polarization effect increasingly evident particularly generation generation individual similar social medium platform video streaming platform like youtube forming group unconsciously intelligent algorithm seeking extreme content owing technology possible individual curate source information opinion exposed thereby reinforcing strengthening view effectively avoiding information perspective disagree one study analyzed tweet twitter regarding shooting george tiller late term abortion doctor tweet analyzed conversation among supporter opponent abortion right post shooting the study found like-minded individual strengthened group identity whereas reply different-minded individual reinforced split affiliation study conducted sia group polarization found occur online computer-mediated discussion particular study found group discussion conducted discussant distributed see one another anonymous identify one another environment lead even higher level group polarization compared traditional meeting this attributed greater number novel argument generated due persuasive argument theory higher incidence one-upmanship behavior due social comparison however research suggests important difference arise measuring group polarization laboratory versus field experiment study conducted taylor macdonald featured realistic setting computer-mediated discussion group polarization occur level expected the study result also showed groupthink occurs le computer-mediated discussion people face face moreover computer-mediated discussion often fail result group consensus lead le satisfaction consensus reached compared group operating natural environment furthermore experiment took place two-week period leading researcher suggest group polarization may occur short-term overall result suggest may group polarization prevalent previous study suggest group theory general may simply transferable seen computer-related discussion group polarization widely discussed term political behavior see political polarization researcher identified increase affective polarization among united state electorate report hostility discrimination towards opposing political party increased dramatically time group polarization similarly influential legal context study assessed whether federal district court judge behaved differently sat alone small group demonstrated judge sat alone took extreme action time whereas judge sat group three took extreme action time these result noteworthy indicate even trained professional decision-makers subject influence group polarization group polarization reported occur wartime time conflict help account partially violent behavior conflict researcher suggested instance ethnic conflict exacerbates group polarization enhancing identification ingroup hostility towards outgroup while polarization occur type conflict damaging effect large-scale inter-group public policy international conflict smaller scale group polarization also seen everyday life student higher education study myers reported initial difference among american college student become accentuated time for example student belong fraternity sorority tend liberal politically difference increase course college career researcher theorize least partially explained group polarization group member tend reinforce one another proclivity opinion
