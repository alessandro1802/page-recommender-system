combination shutter speed f-number give exposure value e.v. according exposure value formula doubling exposure time double amount light subtracts reducing aperture size multiple one square root two

addition effect exposure shutter speed change way movement appears photograph very short shutter speed used freeze fast-moving subject example sporting event very long shutter speed used intentionally blur moving subject effect short exposure time sometimes called fast long exposure time slow adjustment aperture need compensated change shutter speed keep right exposure early day photography available shutter speed standardized though typical sequence might neither aperture film sensitivity least different national standard existed soon problem resulted solution consisting adoption standardized way choosing aperture major step exactly doubled halved amount light entering camera etc standardized scale adopted shutter speed opening one aperture stop reducing amount time shutter speed one step resulted identical exposure the agreed standard shutter speed with scale increment roughly double amount light longer time half shorter time camera shutter often include one two setting making long exposure the ability photographer take image without noticeable blurring camera movement important parameter choice slowest possible shutter speed handheld camera the rough guide used photographer slowest shutter speed used easily without much blur due camera shake shutter speed numerically closest lens focal length for example handheld use camera normal lens closest shutter speed closest lens recommended choose shutter speed second this rule augmented knowledge intended application photograph image intended significant enlargement closeup viewing would require faster shutter speed avoid obvious blur through practice special technique bracing camera arm body minimize camera movement using monopod tripod slower shutter speed used without blur shutter speed slow hand holding camera support usually tripod must used image stabilization digital camera lens often permit use shutter speed stop slower exposure time longer shutter priority refers shooting mode used camera allows photographer choose shutter speed setting allow camera decide correct aperture this sometimes referred shutter speed priority auto exposure time value canon camera mode mode nikons brand shutter speed
