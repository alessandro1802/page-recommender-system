blockchain type distributed ledger technology dlt consists growing list record called block securely linked together using cryptography each block contains cryptographic hash previous block timestamp transaction data generally represented merkle tree data node represented leaf the timestamp prof transaction data existed block created since block contains information previous block effectively form chain compare linked list data structure additional block linking one consequently blockchain transaction irreversible recorded data given block altered retroactively without altering subsequent block blockchains typically managed peer-to-peer computer network use public distributed ledger node collectively adhere consensus algorithm protocol add validate new transaction block although blockchain record unalterable since blockchain fork possible blockchains may considered secure design exemplify distributed computing system high byzantine fault tolerance blockchain created person group people

important way using hashcash-like method timestamp block without requiring signed trusted party introducing difficulty parameter stabilize rate block added chain the design implemented following year nakamoto core component cryptocurrency bitcoin serf public ledger transaction network august bitcoin blockchain file size containing record transaction occurred network reached gigabyte january size

blockchain according accenture application diffusion innovation theory suggests blockchains attained adoption rate within financial service therefore reaching early adopter phase industry trade group

experimentation blockchain for year gartner reported cio believed blockchain technology 'game-changer business blockchain decentralized distributed often public digital ledger consisting record called block used record transaction across many computer involved block altered retroactively without alteration subsequent block this allows participant verify audit transaction independently relatively inexpensively blockchain database managed autonomously using peer-to-peer network distributed timestamping server they authenticated mass collaboration powered collective self-interest such design

blockchain linking two the linked block form chain this iterative process confirms integrity previous block way back initial block known genesis block block assure integrity block data contained block usually digitally signed sometimes separate block produced concurrently creating temporary fork addition secure hash-based history blockchain specified algorithm scoring different version history one higher score selected others block selected inclusion chain called orphan block peer supporting database different version history time time they keep highest-scoring version database known whenever peer receives higher-scoring version usually old version single new block added extend overwrite database retransmit improvement peer there never absolute guarantee particular entry remain best version history forever blockchains typically built add score new block onto old block given incentive extend new block rather overwrite old block therefore probability entry becoming superseded decrease exponentially block built top eventually becoming low for example bitcoin us proof-of-work system chain cumulative proof-of-work considered valid one network there number method used demonstrate sufficient level computation within blockchain computation carried redundantly rather traditional segregated parallel manner the block time average time take network generate one extra block blockchain time block completion included data becomes verifiable cryptocurrency practically transaction take place shorter block time mean faster transaction the block time ethereum set second
