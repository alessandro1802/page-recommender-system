formal semantics study grammatical meaning natural language using formal tool logic theoretical computer science interdisciplinary field sometimes regarded subfield linguistics philosophy language provides account linguistic expression mean meaning composed meaning part the enterprise formal semantics thought reverse-engineering semantic component natural language grammar formal semantics study denotation natural language expression high-level concern include compositionality reference nature meaning key topic area include scope modality binding tense aspect semantics distinct pragmatic encompasses aspect meaning arise interaction communicative intent formal semantics interdisciplinary field often viewed subfield linguistics philosophy also incorporating work computer science mathematical logic cognitive psychology within philosophy formal semanticist typically adopt platonistic ontology externalist view meaning within linguistics common view formal semantics part study linguistic cognition result philosopher put emphasis conceptual issue linguist likely focus syntaxâ€“semantics interface crosslinguistic variation the fundamental question formal semantics know know interpret expression language common assumption knowing meaning sentence requires knowing truth condition word knowing world would like sentence true for instance know meaning english sentence nancy smoke one know true person nancy performs action smoking however many current approach formal semantics posit meaning truth-conditions formal semantic framework inquisitive semantics knowing meaning sentence also requires knowing issue i.e question raise for instance nancy smoke drink conveys truth-conditional information previous example also raise issue whether nancy drink other approach generalize concept truth conditionality treat epiphenomenal for instance dynamic semantics knowing meaning sentence amount knowing update context pietroski treat meaning instruction build concept the principle compositionality fundamental assumption formal semantics this principle state denotation complex expression determined denotation part along mode composition for instance denotation english sentence nancy smoke determined meaning nancy denotation smoke whatever semantic operation combine meaning subject meaning predicate simplified semantic analysis idea would formalized positing nancy denotes nancy smoke denotes function take individual argument return truth value true indeed smoke assuming word nancy smoke semantically composed via function application analysis would predict sentence whole true nancy indeed smoke scope thought semantic order operation for instance sentence paulina n't drink beer drink wine proposition paulina drink beer occurs within scope negation proposition paulina drink wine one major concern research formal semantics relationship operator syntactic position semantic scope this relationship transparent since scope operator need directly correspond surface position single surface form semantically ambiguous different scope construal some theory scope posit level syntactic structure called logical form item syntactic position corresponds semantic scope others theory compute scope relation semantics using formal tool type shifter monad continuation binding phenomenon anaphoric element pronoun grammatically associated antecedent for instance english sentence mary saw anaphor bound antecedent mary binding licensed blocked certain context syntactic configuration e.g pronoun bound mary english sentence mary saw while language binding restriction vary even among closely related language binding major government binding theory paradigm modality phenomenon whereby language used discus potentially non-actual scenario for instance non-modal sentence nancy smoked make claim actual world modalized sentence nancy might smoked nancy smoked 'll sad make claim alternative scenario the intensely studied expression include modal auxiliary could must modal adverb possibly necessarily modal adjective conceivable probable however modal component identified meaning countless natural language expression including counterfactuals propositional attitude evidentials habituals generic the standard treatment linguistic modality proposed angelika kratzer building earlier tradition work modal logic the logical analysis meaning declarative sentence began aristotelian logic however took early pioneering work philosopher logician richard montague formal semantics emerge major area research montague proposed formal system known montague grammar consisted novel syntactic formalism english logical system called intensional logic set homomorphic translation rule linking two retrospect montague grammar compared rube goldberg machine regarded earth-shattering first proposed many fundamental insight survive various semantic model superseded montague grammar major advance showed natural language could treated interpreted formal language before montague many linguist doubted possible logician era tended view logic replacement natural language rather tool analyzing montague work published linguistics war many linguist initially puzzled while linguist wanted restrictive theory could model phenomenon occur human language montague sought flexible framework characterized concept meaning general one conference montague told barbara partee linguist case n't talk formal semantics grew major subfield linguistics late early due seminal work barbara partee partee developed linguistically plausible system incorporated key insight montague grammar transformational grammar early research linguistic formal semantics used partee system achieve wealth empirical conceptual result later work irene heim angelika kratzer tanya reinhart robert may others built partee work reconcile generative approach syntax the resulting framework known heim kratzer system author textbook semantics generative grammar first codified popularized the heim kratzer system differs earlier approach incorporates level syntactic representation called logical form undergoes semantic interpretation thus system often includes syntactic representation operation introduced translation rule montague system however work others gerald gazdar proposed model syntax-semantics interface stayed closer montague providing system interpretation denotation could computed basis surface structure these approach live framework categorial grammar combinatory categorial grammar cognitive semantics emerged reaction formal semantics recently several attempt reconciling position
