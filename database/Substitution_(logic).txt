substitution fundamental concept logic substitution syntactic transformation formal expression apply substitution expression mean consistently replace variable placeholder symbol expression the resulting expression called substitution instance instance short original expression where represent formula propositional logic substitution instance may obtained substituting formula symbol replacing occurrence symbol occurrence formula for example substitution instance substitution instance deduction system propositional logic new expression proposition may entered line derivation substitution instance previous line derivation hunter this new line introduced axiomatic system system use rule transformation rule may include use substitution instance purpose introducing certain variable derivation first-order logic every closed propositional formula obtained open propositional formula substitution said substitution instance closed propositional formula count substitution instance propositional formula tautology true every valuation interpretation predicate symbol tautology substitution instance tautology this fact implies soundness deduction rule described previous section first-order logic substitution total mapping variable term many author additionally require finitely many variable the notation note refers substitution mapping variable corresponding term every variable must pairwise distinct applying substitution term written postfix notation ... mean simultaneously replace every occurrence note the result applying substitution term called instance term for example applying substitution term the domain dom substitution commonly defined set variable actually replaced i.e dom substitution called ground substitution map variable domain ground i.e variable-free term the substitution instance ground substitution ground term variable domain i.e var dom substitution called linear substitution linear term hence every linear term containing precisely variable domain i.e var dom substitution called flat substitution variable every variable substitution called renaming substitution permutation set variable like every permutation renaming substitution always inverse substitution every term however possible define inverse arbitrary substitution for example ground substitution non-ground non-flat linear non-linear non-flat flat non-linear linear flat renaming since map substitution set domain example renaming substitution inverse the flat substitution inverse since e.g x+y z+z latter term transformed back x+y information origin stem lost the ground substitution inverse due similar loss origin information e.g even replacing constant variable allowed fictitious kind generalized substitution two substitution considered equal map variable structurally equal result term formally variable the composition two substitution obtained removing substitution tkτ pair the composition denoted composition associative operation compatible substitution application i.e respectively every substitution every term the identity substitution map every variable neutral element substitution composition substitution called idempotent hence tσσ every term the substitution idempotent none variable occurs substitution composition commutative may different even idempotent for example equal different the substitution y+y idempotent e.g x+y x↦y+y x↦y+y y+y x↦y+y y+y substitution x+y non-idempotent e.g x+y x↦x+y x↦x+y x+y x↦x+y x+y example non-commuting substitution
