formal logic related branch mathematics functional predicate function symbol logical symbol may applied object term produce another object term functional predicate also sometimes called mapping term additional meaning mathematics model function symbol modelled function specifically symbol formal language functional symbol given symbol representing object language symbol representing object language typed logic functional symbol domain type codomain type given symbol representing object type symbol representing object type one similarly define function symbol one variable analogous function one variable function symbol zero variable simply constant symbol now consider model formal language type modelled set symbol type modelled element then modelled set simply function domain codomain requirement consistent model whenever treatment predicate logic allows one introduce new predicate symbol one also want able introduce new function symbol given function symbol one introduce new function symbol composition satisfying course right side equation n't make sense typed logic unless domain type match codomain type required composition defined one also get certain function symbol automatically untyped logic identity predicate satisfies typed logic given type identity predicate idt domain codomain type satisfies idt type similarly subtype inclusion predicate domain type codomain type satisfies equation additional function symbol associated way constructing new type old one additionally one define functional predicate proving appropriate theorem 're working formal system n't allow introduce new symbol proving theorem use relation symbol get around next section specifically prove every every certain type exists unique satisfying condition introduce function symbol indicate note relational predicate involving predicate theorem introduce function symbol domain type codomain type satisfies many treatment predicate logic n't allow functional predicate relational predicate this useful example context proving metalogical theorem gödel incompleteness theorem one n't want allow introduction new functional symbol new symbol matter but method replacing functional symbol relational symbol wherever former may occur furthermore algorithmic thus suitable applying metalogical theorem result specifically domain type codomain type replaced predicate type intuitively mean then whenever would appear statement replace new symbol type include another statement able make deduction need additional proposition course proposition proven theorem introducing new function symbol previous section because elimination functional predicate convenient purpose possible many treatment formal logic deal explicitly function symbol instead use relation symbol another way think functional predicate special kind predicate specifically one satisfies proposition this may seem problem wish specify proposition schema applies functional predicate know ahead time whether satisfies condition get equivalent formulation schema first replace anything form new variable then universally quantify immediately corresponding introduced quantified beginning statement free guard quantification finally make entire statement material consequence uniqueness condition functional predicate let take example axiom schema replacement zermelo–fraenkel set theory this example us mathematical symbol this schema state one form functional predicate one variable first must replace variable course statement n't correct must quantified still must introduce guard quantification this almost correct applies many predicate actually want this version axiom schema replacement suitable use formal language n't allow introduction new function symbol alternatively one may interpret original statement statement formal language merely abbreviation statement produced end
