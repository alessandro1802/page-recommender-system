asteroid belt crew perform unplanned close flyby binary asteroid system pass much closer predicted due discrepancy data provided mission control pegasus performs intense aerobraking maneuver jupiter upper atmosphere put course route pearson receives diagnosis lymphoma received high radiation dose solar flyby upon arriving primary landing site considered unsafe due ongoing volcanic eruption secondary landing site due lethal level radiation after heated discussion mission control whether land still potentially risky tertiary landing site land safe uninteresting quaternary landing site
