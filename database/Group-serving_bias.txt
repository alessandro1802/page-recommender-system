looked psychological root in-group/out-group bias study lab tajfel colleague created minimal group see minimal group paradigm occur complete stranger formed group using trivial criterion imaginable tajfel study participant split group flipping coin group told appreciate certain style painting none participant familiar experiment began what tajfel colleague discovered that—regardless fact participant know group completely meaningless none participant inclination style like better—participants almost always liked member group better rated member in-group likely pleasant personality

self-concept exhibited greater ingroup bias people low self-esteem suffered threat self-concept while study supported notion negative correlation self-esteem in-group bias researcher found individual low self-esteem showed bias toward in-group out-group member some study even shown high-self-esteem group showed bias lower self-esteem group this research may suggest alternative explanation additional reasoning relationship self-esteem in-group/out-group bias alternatively possible researcher used wrong sort self-esteem measure test link self-esteem in-group bias global personal self-esteem rather specific social self-esteem meta-analysis review effect oxytocin social behavior done carsten dreu research reviewed show oxytocin enables development trust specifically towards individual similar characteristics—categorized 'in-group members—promoting cooperation favoritism towards individual this bias oxytocin-induced goodwill towards feature characteristic perceived similar may evolved biological basis sustaining in-group cooperation protection fitting darwinian insight act self-sacrifice cooperation contribute functioning group hence improve odds survival member said group race used example in-group out-group tendency society often categorizes individual group based race caucasian african american latino etc. one study examined race empathy found participant receiving nasally administered oxytocin stronger reaction picture in-group member making pained face picture out-group member expression this show oxytocin may implicated ability empathize individual different race individual one race potentially biased towards helping individual race individual another race experiencing pain oxytocin also implicated lying lying would prove beneficial in-group member study relationship examined found individual administered oxytocin rate dishonesty participant response increased in-group member beneficial outcome group expected both example show tendency

sounding name however bias eastern sounding name present amongst men furthermore men showed bias ashkenazic men compared woman opposite true eastern name this result may seem counter-intuitive participant appear share common male thus would expect eastern female marginalized actually consistent study studied discrimination afro-american woman fehr bernhard rockenbach study conducted child found boy displayed in-group favoritism age whereas girl display tendency the experiment involved usage envy game modified version dictator game possible explanation posited researcher relied evolutionary basis they theorized parochialism favoring member group may particularly advantageous strengthened individual group position intergroup conflict male one frequently forefront conflict past thus bore majority cost conflict term injury death evolution may favored greater sensitivity male situation resulted advantageous payoff in-group thus male tended show in-group bias younger age

collected three separate period june hillary clinton concession speech june august democratic national convention september buildup presidential election the result showed men displayed significant in-group favoritism june way dnc august this in-group bias however present september woman displayed significant in-group favoritism throughout the experiment suggested group identity flexible change time researcher theorized in-group bias strong june competition democratic nominee election still recent thus salient lack actual electoral conflict republican caused perception salient grouping remain throughout august only september in-group favoritism subside superordinate goal shared group present research analyzing article inter-group conflict e.g. falklands war comparing corresponding language version wikipedia e.g. english spanish found evidence in-group favoritism while in-group systematically preferred presented favorable light out-group presented immoral responsible conflict there substantial variation conflict however additional analysis revealed in-group favoritism pronounced recent conflict article written predominantly in-group member social psychologist long made distinction ingroup favoritism outgroup negativity outgroup negativity act punishing placing burden upon outgroup indeed significant body research exists attempt identify relationship ingroup favoritism outgroup negativity well condition lead outgroup negativity for example struch schwartz found support prediction belief congruence theory the belief congruence theory concern degree similarity belief attitude value perceived exist individual this theory also state dissimilarity increase negative orientation towards others when applied racial discrimination belief congruence theory argues perceived dissimilarity belief impact racial discrimination race research find evidence in-group bias police investigation judicial decision oxytocin correlated preference individual associate member group also evident conflict member different group during conflict individual receiving nasally administered oxytocin demonstrate frequent defense-motivated response toward in-group member out-group member further oxytocin correlated participant desire protect vulnerable in-group member despite individual attachment conflict similarly demonstrated oxytocin administered individual alter subjective preference order align in-group ideal out-group ideal these study demonstrate oxytocin associated intergroup dynamic further oxytocin influence response individual particular group another group the in-group bias evident smaller group however also extended group large one entire country leading toward tendency strong national zeal study done netherlands showed oxytocin increased in-group favoritism nation decreasing acceptance member ethnicity foreigner people also show affection country flag remaining indifferent cultural object exposed oxytocin thus hypothesized hormone may

member in-group demonstrating ambivalence towards unfavorable characteristic acknowledged in-group according ma-kellam al. culturally-ingrained attitude belief rather low self-esteem may play role collectivist culture in-group derogation due ability tolerate holding seemingly contradictory view
