considerably volatile known releasing largest amount firedamp dangerous explosive mixture gas chiefly methane firedamp explosive concentration violence around addition another potential contributing factor bituminous coal iron sulfide also known pyrite likely present the presence pyrite present two additional risk factor first involving oxidation pyrite oxidation sufficiently exothermic underground coal mine high-sulfur coal seam occasionally experienced spontaneous combustion mined-out area mine this process result disruption caused mining seam expose sulfide ore air water the
