emotion classification mean one may distinguish contrast one emotion another contested issue emotion research affective science researcher approached classification emotion one two fundamental viewpoint discrete emotion theory human thought innate set basic emotion cross-culturally recognizable these basic emotion described discrete believed distinguishable individual facial expression biological process theorist conducted study determine emotion basic popular example paul ekman colleague cross-cultural study concluded six basic emotion anger disgust fear happiness sadness surprise ekman explains particular characteristic attached emotion allowing expressed varying degree each emotion act discrete category rather individual emotional state human subjective experience emotion clearly recognizable others this apparent ease recognition led identification number emotion said basic universal among people however debate among expert questioned understanding emotion there recent discussion progression different view emotion year basic emotion account activation emotion anger sadness fear triggered brain appraisal stimulus event respect perceiver goal survival particular function expression meaning different emotion hypothesized biologically distinct one another theme common many basic emotion theory functional signature distinguish different emotion able tell emotion person feeling looking brain activity and/or physiology furthermore knowledge person seeing larger context eliciting event necessary deduce person feeling observing biological signature constructionist account emotion person feel response stimulus event constructed elemental biological psychological ingredient two hypothesized ingredient core affect characterized e.g. hedonic valence physiological arousal conceptual knowledge semantic meaning emotion label e.g. word anger theme common many constructionist theory different emotion specific location nervous system distinct physiological signature context central emotion person feel accessibility different concept afforded different context eugene bann proposed theory people transmit understanding emotion language use surround mentioned emotion keywords posit distinct language used express certain emotion distinct perception including proprioception emotion thus basic this allows select dimension best representing entire spectrum emotion coincidentally found ekman basic emotion set arguably frequently used classifying emotion semantically distinct for theoretical practical reason researcher define emotion

proposed emotion described three dimension pleasurable versus unpleasurable arousing subduing strain relaxation harold schlosberg named three dimension emotion pleasantness–unpleasantness

dimension dimensional model emotion suggest common interconnected neurophysiological system responsible affective state these model contrast theory basic emotion propose different emotion arise separate neural system several dimensional model emotion developed though remain dominant model currently accepted the two-dimensional model prominent circumplex model vector model positive activation negative activation pana model the circumplex model emotion developed james russell this model suggests emotion distributed two-dimensional circular space containing arousal valence dimension arousal represents vertical axis valence represents horizontal axis center circle represents neutral valence medium level arousal model emotional state represented level valence arousal neutral level one factor circumplex model used commonly test stimulus emotion word emotional facial expression affective state russell lisa feldman barrett describe modified circumplex model representative core affect elementary feeling necessarily directed toward anything different prototypical emotional episode clear emotion evoked directed specific object plotted circumplex according level arousal pleasure the vector model emotion appeared this two-dimensional model consists vector point two direction representing boomerang shape the model assumes always underlying arousal dimension valence determines direction particular emotion lie for example positive valence would shift emotion top vector negative valence would shift emotion bottom vector model high arousal state differentiated valence whereas low arousal state neutral represented near meeting point vector vector model widely used testing word picture stimulus the positive activation negative activation pana consensual model emotion originally created watson tellegen suggests positive affect negative affect two separate system similar vector model state higher arousal tend defined valence state lower arousal tend neutral term valence pana model vertical axis represents low high positive affect horizontal axis represents low high negative affect the dimension valence arousal lay rotation ax robert plutchik offer

dyad the pad emotional state model psychological model developed albert mehrabian james russell describe measure emotional state pad us three numerical dimension represent emotion the pad dimension pleasure arousal dominance the pleasure-displeasure scale measure pleasant emotion may for instance anger fear unpleasant emotion score high displeasure scale however joy pleasant emotion the arousal-nonarousal scale measure energized soporific one feel intensity emotion—for grief depression low arousal intense feeling while anger rage unpleasant emotion rage higher intensity higher arousal state however boredom also unpleasant state low arousal value the dominance-submissiveness scale represents controlling dominant nature emotion for instance fear anger unpleasant emotion anger dominant emotion fear submissive emotion ethnographic cross-cultural study emotion shown variety way emotion differ culture because difference many cross-cultural psychologist anthropologist challenge idea universal classification emotion altogether cultural difference observed way emotion valued expressed regulated the social norm emotion frequency circumstance expressed also vary drastically for

emotion taxonomy language differ categorize emotion based different component some may categorize event type whereas others categorize action readiness furthermore emotion taxonomy vary due differing
