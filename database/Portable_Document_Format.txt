portable document format pdf standardized iso file format developed adobe present document including text formatting image manner independent application software hardware operating system based postscript language pdf file encapsulates complete description fixed-layout flat document including text font vector graphic raster image information needed display pdf root the camelot project

historically postscript-like pdf code generated source postscript file the graphic command output postscript code collected tokenized clarification needed any file graphic font document refers also collected then everything compressed single file therefore entire postscript world font layout measurement remains intact citation needed document format pdf several advantage postscript pdf later support interactive document embedded pdf file drawing embedded using prc various data format pdf file organized using ascii character except certain element may binary content the file start header containing magic number readable string version format example the format subset co carousel object structure format co tree file consists primarily object nine type furthermore may comment introduced

document root beginning pdf version indirect object except stream may also located special stream known object stream marked /type /objstm this technique enables non-stream object standard stream filter applied reduces size file large number small indirect object especially useful tagged pdf object stream support specifying object generation number index table also called cross-reference table located near end file give byte offset indirect object start file this design allows efficient random access object file also allows small change made without rewriting entire file incremental update before pdf version table would always special ascii format marked xref keyword follow main body composed indirect object version introduced optional cross-reference stream form standard stream object possibly filter applied such stream may used instead ascii cross-reference table contains offset information binary format the format flexible allows integer width specification using array example document exceeding kib size may dedicate byte object offset end pdf file footer containing cross-reference stream used footer preceded trailer keyword followed dictionary containing information would

pdf support several type pattern the simplest tiling pattern piece artwork specified drawn repeatedly this may colored tiling pattern color specified pattern object uncolored tiling pattern defers color specification time pattern drawn beginning pdf also shading pattern draw continuously varying color there seven type shading pattern simplest axial shading type radial shading type raster image pdf called image xobjects represented dictionary associated stream the dictionary describes property image stream contains image data le commonly small raster image may embedded directly page description inline image image typically filtered compression purpose image filter supported pdf include following general-purpose filter normally image content pdf embedded file but pdf allows image data stored external file use external stream alternate image standardized subset pdf including pdf/a pdf/x prohibit feature text pdf represented text element page content stream text element specifies character drawn certain position the character specified using encoding selected font resource font object pdf description digital typeface may either describe characteristic typeface may

original imaging model pdf like postscript opaque object drawn page completely replaced anything previously marked location pdf imaging model extended allow transparency when transparency used new
