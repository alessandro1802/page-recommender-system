logic especially mathematical logic hilbert system sometimes called hilbert calculus hilbert-style deductive system hilbert–ackermann system type system formal deduction attributed gottlob frege david hilbert these deductive system often studied first-order logic interest logic well most variant hilbert system take characteristic tack way balance trade-off logical axiom rule inference hilbert system characterised choice large number scheme logical axiom small set rule inference system natural deduction take opposite tack including many deduction rule axiom scheme the commonly studied hilbert system either one rule inference modus ponens propositional logic two generalisation handle predicate logic well several infinite axiom scheme hilbert system propositional modal logic sometimes called hilbert-lewis system generally axiomatised two additional rule necessitation rule uniform substitution rule characteristic feature many variant hilbert system context changed rule

judgment rather simple form the done two deduction system citation needed context changed rule inference formalized hypothetical judgment could avoided even want use proving derivability tautology hilbert-style deduction system formal deduction finite sequence formula formula either axiom obtained previous formula rule inference these formal deduction meant mirror natural-language proof although far detailed suppose \displaystyle \gamma set formula considered hypothesis for example \displaystyle \gamma could set axiom group theory set theory the notation \displaystyle \gamma \vdash
