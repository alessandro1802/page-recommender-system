recursion adjective recursive occurs thing defined term type recursion used variety discipline ranging linguistics logic the common application recursion mathematics computer science function defined applied within definition while apparently defines infinite number instance function value often done way infinite loop infinite chain reference crock recursion occur mathematics computer science class object method exhibit recursive behavior defined two property for example following recursive definition person ancestor one ancestor either the fibonacci sequence another classic example recursion many mathematical axiom based upon recursive rule for example formal definition natural number peano axiom described zero natural number natural number successor also natural number base case recursive rule one generate set natural number other recursively defined mathematical object include factorial function e.g. recurrence relation set e.g. cantor ternary set fractal there various tongue-in-cheek definition recursion see recursive humor recursion process procedure go one step procedure involves invoking procedure procedure go recursion said 'recursive understand recursion one must recognize distinction procedure running procedure procedure set step based set rule running procedure involves actually following rule performing step recursion related reference within

recursion come three form direct indirect circular direct recursion function invokes reference indirect recursion occurs one function invokes function invokes function function invokes etc. one function chain invokes earlier one circular recursion occurs function function invoke infinite loop occurs direct indirect circular recursion said condition crock recursion there basically two way prevent crock recursion either limit number time function may reference place absolute limit depth function call e.g depth limit time procedure call another counter increased exit counter decreased once counter reach limit case procedure call allowed attempt call function made operation terminated using recursion limit prevents crock recursion placing call limit addition halting crock recursion may side effect preventing execution legitimate complex procedure deeply nested recursive but even properly defined recursive procedure easy human perform requires distinguishing new old partially executed invocation procedure requires administration far various simultaneous instance procedure progressed for reason recursive definition rare everyday situation linguist noam chomsky among many others argued lack upper bound number grammatical sentence language lack upper bound grammatical sentence length beyond practical constraint time available utter one explained consequence recursion natural language this understood term recursive definition syntactic category sentence sentence structure follows verb another sentence dorothy think witch dangerous sentence witch dangerous occurs larger one sentence defined recursively roughly something structure includes noun phrase verb optionally another sentence this really special case mathematical definition recursion this provides way understanding creativity language—the unbounded number grammatical sentences—because immediately predicts sentence arbitrary length dorothy think toto suspect tin man said .... there many structure apart sentence defined recursively therefore many way sentence embed instance one category inside another over year language general proved amenable kind analysis the generally accepted idea recursion essential property human language challenged daniel everett basis claim pirahã language andrew nevins david pesetsky cilene rodrigues among many refuted challenge literary self-reference case argued different kind mathematical logical recursion recursion play crucial role syntax also natural language semantics the word example construed function apply sentence meaning create new sentence likewise noun phrase meaning verb phrase meaning others also apply intransitive verb transitive verb ditransitive verb order provide single denotation suitably flexible typically defined take different type meaning argument this done defining simple case combine sentence defining case recursively term simple one recursive grammar formal grammar contains recursive production rule recursion sometimes used
