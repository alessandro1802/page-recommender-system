set theory cantor diagonal argument also called diagonalisation argument diagonal slash argument anti-diagonal argument diagonal method cantor diagonalization proof published georg cantor mathematical proof infinite set put one-to-one correspondence infinite set natural number such set known uncountable set size infinite set treated theory cardinal number cantor began the diagonal argument cantor first proof uncountability real number appeared however demonstrates general technique since used wide range proof including first gödel incompleteness theorem turing answer entscheidungsproblem diagonalization argument often also source contradiction like russell paradox richard paradox cantor considered set infinite sequence binary digit i.e digit zero one note begin constructive proof following lemma the proof start enumeration element example next sequence constructed choosing digit complementary digit swapping vice versa digit complementary digit digit complementary digit generally every nth digit complementary nth digit for example yield construction member differs since nth digit differ highlighted example hence occur enumeration based lemma cantor us proof contradiction show the proof start assuming countable then element written enumeration ... ... applying previous lemma enumeration produce sequence member enumeration however enumerated every member including enumeration this contradiction implies original assumption false therefore uncountable the uncountability real number already established cantor first uncountability proof also follows result prove injection constructed set infinite binary string set real number since uncountable image function subset uncountable therefore uncountable also using method construction devised cantor bijection constructed therefore cardinality called cardinality continuum usually denoted \displaystyle \mathfrak \displaystyle \aleph injection given mapping binary string decimal fraction mapping ... decimal .... this function defined injection map different string different number note constructing bijection slightly complicated instead mapping ... decimal ... mapped base number ... this lead family function the function injection except this function modified produce bijection this construction us method devised cantor published used construct bijection closed interval irrational open interval first removed countably infinite subset set bijection remaining uncountable set since bijection countably infinite subset removed combining two bijections produce bijection original set cantor method used modify function produce bijection because number two binary expansion even injective for example ... ... ... ... ... ... ... map number modify observe bijection except countably infinite subset countably infinite subset bijection number two binary expansion these called dyadic number form odd integer natural number put number sequence ... also bijection string appearing binary point binary expansion number sequence put eventually-constant string sequence ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... define bijection nth string sequence let nth number sequence otherwise construct bijection start tangent function tan bijection see figure shown right next observe linear function bijection see figure shown left the composite function tan tan bijection composing function produce function tan tan bijection generalized form diagonal argument used cantor prove cantor theorem every set power set s—that set subset written bijection this proof proceeds follows let function suffices prove surjective that mean member i.e subset image candidate consider set for every either definition equal hand definition equal picture for complete account proof see cantor theorem cantor

argument thus used establish example although set consideration infinite actually infinite sequence one zero natural number cantor result also implies notion set set inconsistent set set would time bigger subset assuming law excluded middle every subcountable set property term surjections also already countable constructive mathematics harder impossible order ordinal also cardinal for example schröder–bernstein theorem requires law excluded middle therefore intuitionists accept theorem cardinal ordering the ordering real standard ordering extending rational number also necessarily decidable neither property interesting class function decidable rice theorem i.e right set counting number subcountable set may recursive set theory theory mathematics modeled for example set theory set real number identified set fulfills axiom real number various model studied dedekind real cauchy real weaker axiom mean le constraint allow richer class model consequently otherwise constructive

insight set real number bigger set natural number one led ask set whose cardinality integer real this question lead famous continuum hypothesis similarly question whether exists set whose cardinality |s| infinite lead generalized continuum hypothesis russell paradox shown naive set theory based unrestricted comprehension scheme contradictory note similarity construction set russell paradox therefore depending modify axiom scheme comprehension order avoid russell paradox argument non-existence set set may may remain valid analogue diagonal argument widely used mathematics prove existence nonexistence certain object for example conventional proof unsolvability halting problem essentially diagonal argument also diagonalization originally used show existence arbitrarily hard complexity class played key role early attempt prove equal the proof fails quine new foundation set theory naive axiom scheme comprehension modified avoid paradox introducing kind local type theory axiom scheme set i.e. satisfy axiom scheme hand might try create modified diagonal argument noticing set case set one-element subset proposed bijection one able use proof contradiction prove the proof follows fact indeed map onto could find coincides modified diagonal set would conclude vice versa possible put one-to-one relation two different type function defined would violate typing rule comprehension scheme
