logic linguistics proposition meaning declarative sentence philosophy meaning understood non-linguistic entity shared sentence meaning equivalently proposition non-linguistic bearer truth falsity make sentence express either true false while term proposition may sometimes used everyday language refer linguistic statement either true false technical philosophical term differs mathematical usage refers exclusively non-linguistic meaning behind statement the term often used broadly also refer various related concept history philosophy contemporary analytic philosophy generally used refer following the primary bearer truth value true false object belief propositional attitude i.e believed doubted etc referent -clauses e.g true sky blue believe sky blue involve proposition sky blue meaning declarative sentence since proposition defined sharable object attitude primary bearer truth falsity mean term proposition refer particular thought particular utterance sharable across different instance refer concrete event fact false propositional logic deal primarily proposition logical relation aristotelian logic identifies categorical proposition sentence affirms denies predicate subject optionally help copula aristotelian proposition may take form all men mortal socrates man first example subject men predicate mortal copula second example subject socrates predicate man copula often proposition related closed formula logical sentence distinguish expressed open formula sense proposition statement truth-bearers this conception proposition supported philosophical school logical positivism some philosopher argue kind speech action besides declarative one also propositional content for example yes–no question present proposition inquiry truth value hand sign declarative assertion proposition without forming sentence even linguistic e.g traffic sign convey definite meaning either true false proposition also spoken content belief similar intentional attitude desire preference hope for example desire new car wonder whether snow whether case snow desire belief doubt thus called propositional attitude take sort content bertrand russell held proposition structured entity object property constituent one important difference ludwig wittgenstein view according proposition set possible worlds/states affair true russellian account two proposition true state affair still differentiated for instance proposition two plus two equal four distinct russellian account proposition three plus three equal six proposition set possible world however mathematical truth necessary truth set set possible world citation needed relation mind proposition discussed primarily fit propositional attitude propositional attitude simply attitude characteristic folk psychology belief desire etc one take toward proposition e.g 'it raining 'snow white etc. english proposition usually follow folk psychological attitude clause e.g jane belief raining philosophy mind psychology mental state often taken primarily consist propositional attitude the proposition usually said mental content attitude for example jane mental state believing raining mental content proposition 'it raining furthermore since mental state something namely proposition said intentional mental state explaining relation proposition mind especially difficult non-mentalist view proposition logical positivist russell described gottlob frege view proposition platonist entity existing abstract non-physical realm recent view proposition taken mental although proposition particular thought since shareable could type cognitive event property thought could across different thinker philosophical debate surrounding proposition relate propositional attitude also recently centered whether internal external agent whether mind-dependent mind-independent entity for see entry internalism externalism philosophy mind noted aristotelian logic proposition particular kind sentence declarative sentence affirms denies predicate subject optionally help copula aristotelian proposition take form like all men mortal socrates man proposition show modern formal logic sentence formal language formal language begin different type symbol these type include variable operator function symbol predicate relation symbol quantifier propositional constant grouping symbol delimiters often added convenience using language play logical role symbol concatenated together according recursive rule order construct string truth-values assigned the rule specify operator function predicate symbol quantifier concatenated string proposition string specific form the form proposition take depends type logic the type logic called propositional sentential statement logic includes operator propositional constant symbol language the proposition language propositional constant considered atomic proposition composite compound proposition composed recursively applying operator proposition application simply short way saying corresponding concatenation rule applied the type logic called predicate quantificational n-order logic include variable operator predicate function symbol quantifier symbol language the proposition logic complex first one typically start defining term follows for example binary function symbol variable y+z term might written symbol various order once term defined proposition defined follows for example binary predicate symbol quantifier x+z y+z proposition this complex structure proposition allows logic make finer distinction inference i.e. greater expressive power context proposition also called sentence statement statement form formula well-formed formula though term usually synonymous within single text this definition treat proposition syntactic object opposed semantic mental object that proposition sense meaningless formal abstract object they assigned meaning truth-values mapping called interpretation valuation respectively mathematics proposition often constructed interpreted way similar predicate logic—albeit informal way for example axiom conceived proposition loose sense word though term usually used refer proven mathematical statement whose importance generally neutral nature other similar term category include proposition called structured proposition constituent broad sense assuming structured view proposition one distinguish singular proposition also russellian proposition named bertrand russell particular individual general proposition particular individual particularized proposition particular individual contain individual constituent attempt provide workable definition proposition include following two meaningful declarative sentence express proposition mean thing citation needed defines proposition term synonymity for example snow white english schnee ist weiß german different sentence say thing express proposition another definition proposition two meaningful declarative sentence-tokens express proposition mean thing citation needed unfortunately definition result two identical sentences/sentence-tokens appearing meaning thus expressing proposition yet different truth-values spartacus said spartacus said john smith wednesday said wednesday thursday these example reflect problem ambiguity common language resulting mistaken equivalence statement spartacus spoken spartacus declaration individual speaking called spartacus true when spoken john smith declaration different speaker false the term mean different thing spartacus mean different thing related problem identical sentence truth-value yet express different proposition the sentence philosopher could spoken socrates plato instance statement true mean something different these problem addressed predicate logic using variable problematic term philosopher socrates plato substituted illustrating socrates philosopher plato philosopher different proposition similarly spartacus becomes spartacus replaced term representing individual spartacus john smith word example problem averted sentence formulated precision term unambiguous meaning number philosopher linguist claim definition proposition vague useful for misleading concept removed philosophy semantics quine granted existence set mathematics maintained indeterminacy translation prevented meaningful discussion proposition discarded favor sentence strawson hand advocated use term statement
