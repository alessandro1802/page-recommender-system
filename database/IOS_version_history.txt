https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_version_history
iOS is a mobile operating system developed by Apple Inc. It was first released as iPhone OS in June 2007.[1] iPhone OS was renamed iOS following the release of the iPad, starting with iOS 4.[2] With iOS 13, Apple began offering a separate operating system, iPadOS, for the iPad. iOS is also the foundation of the newer audioOS and tvOS, and shares some of its code with macOS. New iOS versions are released every year alongside new iPhone models. From its launch in 2007 until 2010, this occurred in June or July; since then, new major versions are released in September or October.  Apple announced iPhone OS 1 at the iPhone keynote on January 9, 2007, and it was released to the public alongside the original iPhone on June 29, 2007.[5] No official name was given when the iPhone was first released; Apple marketing literature simply stated the iPhone ran a mobile version of "OS X".[6]  During the development phase of iPhone OS 1, there were at least 17-18 different concepts developed. Many on the team were still hung up on the idea that everyone would want to type on a hardware keyboard, not a glass screen. The idea of introducing a complete touch screen was very novel to everyone.[7] Many user interfaces were prototyped, including the multi-touch click-wheel. Although many thought it was a waste of time, Apple CEO Steve Jobs insisted on prototyping all concepts before the Mac OS-X-based version of the operating system was selected. The release of iPhone OS 1.1 brought support for the iPod Touch (1st generation). iPhone OS 1.1.4 is the final version of iPhone OS 1 for the iPhone 2G, and iPhone OS 1.1.5 is the final version of iPhone OS 1 for the iPod Touch (1st generation). It was succeeded by iPhone OS 2 on July 11, 2008. It became unsupported on May 18, 2010. Apple announced iPhone OS 2 at the 2008 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 9, and it was released to the public on July 11, 2008, alongside the iPhone 3G. iPhone OS 2 was the first release to have the App Store, allowing developers to create official third-party apps for the iPhone; previously, people had to download jailbreaks to do this. This OS was made available to iPod touch users for a fee of $9.95 in which it introduced key requested features such as a push email. Apple did not drop support for any of its devices with the release; iPhone OS 2 was compatible with all devices released up to that time. The release of iPhone OS 2.1.1 brought support for the iPod Touch (2nd generation). iPhone OS 2.2.1 is the final version of iPhone OS 2. It was succeeded by iPhone OS 3 on August 11, 2009. Apple announced iPhone OS 3 on March 17, 2009, and it was released to the public on June 17, 2009, alongside the iPhone 3GS. Apple did not drop support for any devices with this release. iPhone OS 3 was compatible with all devices released up to that time, but not all features were available on the original iPhone. The final release supported on the original iPhone and iPod Touch (1st generation) is iPhone OS 3.1.3. The first iPad was introduced along with iPhone OS 3.2.[33][34] iPhone OS 3 was succeeded by iOS 4 on June 21, 2010. Apple announced iOS 4 in March 2010 and it was released to the public on June 21, 2010, alongside the iPhone 4. It was the first version of the operating system to be called "iOS". With this release, Apple dropped support for the original iPhone and the 1st generation iPod Touch, which is the first time Apple had dropped support for any device in an iOS release. The iPhone 3G and the 2nd generation iPod Touch were capable of running iOS 4, but had limited features. For example, both devices lacked multitasking, and the ability to set a custom home screen wallpaper. This was also the first major release to be free of charge for iPod Touch users. The release of iOS 4.2.1 brought compatibility to the original iPad and was the final release supported on the iPhone 3G and 2nd generation iPod Touch due to huge performance issues. The release of iOS 4.3 added support for the iPad 2.[45][46] It was succeeded by iOS 5 on October 12, 2011.
