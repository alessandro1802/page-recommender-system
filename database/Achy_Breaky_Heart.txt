"Achy Breaky Heart" is a song written in 1990 by Don Von Tress. First released in 1991 by the Marcy Brothers with the title "Don't Tell My Heart", it was later recorded by Billy Ray Cyrus and released on his debut album Some Gave All in 1992. The song is Cyrus' debut single and signature song. It became the first single ever to achieve triple platinum status in Australia[1] and also 1992's best-selling single in the same country.[2][3] In the United States, it became a crossover hit on pop and country radio, peaking at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topping the Hot Country Songs chart, becoming the first country single to be certified platinum since "Islands in the Stream" by Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton in 1983.[4] The single topped in several countries, and after being featured on Top of the Pops in the United Kingdom, peaked at No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart. It was Cyrus' biggest hit single in the U.S. until he was featured on "Old Town Road" by rapper Lil Nas X, which peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 27 years later.[5] The music video for the song led to the explosion of the line dance into the mainstream.[6][7][8][9] The song is considered by some as one of the worst songs of all time, featuring at No. 2 on VH1 and Blender's list of the "50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs Ever".[10] However, it later became a cult classic. Achy Breaky Heart was written by amateur songwriter Don Von Tress from Cypress Inn, Tennessee, in 1990, according to him "just fooling around on the guitar and a drum machine".[11] The song was initially to be recorded by the Oak Ridge Boys in the early 1990s, but the group decided against recording it after lead singer Duane Allen said that he did not like the words "achy breaky".[12] It was then recorded in 1991 under the title "Don't Tell My Heart" by the Marcy Brothers, although their version changed some lyrics. Billy Ray Cyrus heard Von Tress's version of the song, and chose to include it on his debut album Some Gave All in 1992.  It is written in the key of A major and has only two chords: A and E. The song reached No. 23 on CMT's 100 Greatest Videos in 2008, No. 2 on VH1's 50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs, and Blender magazine's 50 Worst Songs Ever.[10] In 2002, Shelly Fabian from About.com ranked the song No. 249 on the list of the Top 500 Country Music Songs.[13] In 2007, the song was ranked at No. 87 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s.[14] A review from Cash Box magazine was positive, stating that "The song is good, but it [sic] his performance that will keep you wired."[15] Despite its initially negative critical reviews, the song has become a cult classic. For his 2017 album Set the Record Straight, Cyrus recorded an updated version of the song.[16] Members of the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section participated in the recording Rolling Stone called "more faithful to songwriter Don Von Tress’ swampy demo."[17] Two very similar versions of the video for the song exist. Directed by Marc Ball, it was filmed during a live performance at the Paramount Arts Center in Ashland, Kentucky. The version released to country stations begins with a shot of the theater and ends with extended applause from the audience. The version released to MTV (which is the version found on Cyrus' YouTube account), begins with Cyrus exiting a limo, and the ending cheer from the audience is much shorter. Alvin and the Chipmunks covered the song in 1992 on Chipmunks in Low Places. This version, which features speaking parts by Cyrus himself, reached No. 71 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, becoming their first entry on any Billboard chart in 32 years.[18] In the United Kingdom, this version peaked at No. 53 in late December 1992,[19] while in Australia, it reached No. 61 in early 1993.[20] "Weird Al" Yankovic parodied the song on his album Alapalooza as Achy Breaky Song, in which he pleads with the DJ not to play Billy Ray Cyrus's "Achy Breaky Heart" anymore; he can tolerate ABBA, Village People, New Kids on the Block, even Slim Whitman and Yoko Ono, but he'll really go bonkers if he has to hear "Achy Breaky Heart" once more. In 2014, rapper Buck 22 released a hip-hop version of the song with Cyrus called "Achy Breaky 2", in which Cyrus reprised his role for the chorus. While Cyrus does never explicitly say the song is a parody, the lyrics and accompanying video clearly make several references to daughter Miley's bad-girl image at the time, with Billy Ray noting in a Rolling Stone article that he "[hopes] that she got to read the one critic who wrote that the video made her performance at the VMAs look like Sesame Street".[21] Supporters of many UK football clubs have used chants based on the tune of the song, including West Ham United (about Dimitri Payet), Arsenal F.C. (about Mesut Özil), Newcastle United F.C.,[22] Cardiff City F.C. (about Malky Mackay),[23] Celtic F.C. and Manchester United F.C. (about Park Ji-sung).[22] It has also been adapted as "Don't Take Me Home", which has been sung by the supporters of several national football teams, including England, Wales, the Republic of Ireland and Sweden. The chant was particularly associated with Wales' run to the semi-finals of UEFA Euro 2016,[24] and lent its name to Don't Take Me Home, a documentary film about the team's performances at that tournament.[25] CD maxi 7-inch single  Cyrus' version of the song spent five weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts in 1992. This was the longest time spent at the top of that chart by a debut single since "Skip a Rope" by Henson Cargill in 1967, and the last until "Austin" by Blake Shelton in 2001.[26]  * Sales figures based on certification alone.^ Shipments figures based on certification alone.
