chemistry organic compound generally chemical compound contain carbon-hydrogen carbon-carbon bond due carbon ability catenate form chain carbon atom million organic compound known the study property reaction synthesis organic compound comprise discipline known organic chemistry for historical reason class carbon-containing compound e.g. carbonate salt cyanide salt along exception e.g. carbon dioxide hydrogen cyanide classified organic compound considered inorganic other named little consensus exists among chemist precisely carbon-containing compound excluded making rigorous definition organic compound elusive although organic compound make small percentage earth crust central importance known life based organic compound living thing incorporate inorganic carbon compound organic compound network process carbon cycle begin conversion carbon dioxide hydrogen source like water simple sugar organic molecule autotrophic organism using light photosynthesis source energy most synthetically-produced organic compound ultimately derived petrochemical consisting mainly hydrocarbon formed high pressure temperature degradation organic matter underground geological timescales this ultimate derivation notwithstanding organic compound longer defined compound originating living thing historically chemical nomenclature organyl group frequently represented letter refers monovalent substituent whose open valence carbon atom for historical reason discussed type carbon-containing compound carbide carbonate excluding carbonate ester simple oxide carbon example cyanide considered inorganic different form allotrope pure carbon diamond graphite fullerene carbon nanotube also excluded simple substance composed single element therefore generally considered chemical compound also important note word organic context mean natural vitalism widespread conception substance found organic nature formed chemical element action vital force life-force vi vitalis living organism posse jöns jacob berzelius argued regulative force must exist within living body berzelius also contended compound could distinguished whether required organism synthesis organic compound whether inorganic compound vitalism taught formation organic compound fundamentally different inorganic compound could obtained element chemical manipulation laboratory vitalism survived short period formulation modern idea atomic theory chemical element first came question friedrich wöhler synthesized oxalic acid compound known occur living organism cyanogen experiment wöhler synthesis urea inorganic salt potassium cyanate ammonium sulfate urea long considered organic compound known occur urine living organism wöhler experiment followed many others increasingly complex organic substance produced inorganic one without involvement living organism thus disproving vitalism although vitalism discredited scientific nomenclature retains distinction organic inorganic compound the modern meaning organic compound compound contains significant amount carbon—even though many organic compound known today connection substance found living organism the term carbogenic proposed corey modern alternative organic neologism remains relatively obscure the organic compound l-isoleucine molecule present feature typical organic compound carbon–carbon bond carbon–hydrogen bond well covalent bond carbon oxygen nitrogen described detail definition organic compound us simple broadly-applicable criterion turn unsatisfactory varying degree the modern commonly accepted definition organic compound essentially amount carbon-containing compound excluding several class substance traditionally considered 'inorganic however list substance excluded varies author author still generally agreed upon least carbon-containing compound considered organic for instance almost authority would require exclusion alloy contain carbon including steel contains cementite well metal semimetal carbide including ionic carbide e.g covalent carbide e.g sic graphite intercalation compound e.g other compound material considered 'inorganic authority include metal carbonate simple oxide arguably allotrope carbon cyanide derivative containing organic residue e.g. kcn brcn cno− etc heavier analog thereof e.g. cp− 'cyaphide anion co although 'carbon disulfide often classed organic solvent halide carbon without hydrogen e.g. phosgene carboranes metal carbonyl e.g. nickel carbonyl mellitic anhydride exotic oxocarbons also considered inorganic authority nickel carbonyl metal carbonyl often volatile liquid like many organic compound yet contain carbon bonded transition metal oxygen often prepared directly metal carbon monoxide nickel carbonyl typically classified organometallic compound satisfies broad definition organometallic chemistry cover compound contain least one carbon metal covalent bond debatable whether organometallic compound form subset organic compound however for example evidence covalent fe-c bonding cementite major component steel place within broad definition organometallic yet steel carbon-containing alloy seldom regarded organic compound thus unclear whether definition organometallic narrowed whether consideration imply organometallic compound necessarily organic metal complex organic ligand carbon-metal bond e.g. oac considered organometallic instead classed metalorganic likewise also unclear whether metalorganic compound automatically considered organic the relatively narrow definition organic compound containing c-h bond excludes compound historically practically considered organic neither urea oxalic acid organic definition yet two key compound vitalism debate the iupac blue book organic nomenclature specifically mention urea oxalic acid other compound lacking c-h bond traditionally considered organic include benzenehexol mesoxalic acid carbon tetrachloride mellitic acid contains c-h bond considered possible organic substance martian soil terrestrially anhydride mellitic anhydride associated mineral mellite coo slightly broader definition organic compound includes compound bearing c-h c-c bond this would still exclude urea moreover definition still lead somewhat arbitrary division set carbon-halogen compound for example would considered rule inorganic whereas would organic though compound share many physical chemical property organic compound may classified variety way one major distinction natural synthetic compound organic compound also classified subdivided presence heteroatoms e.g. organometallic compound feature bond carbon metal organophosphorus compound feature bond carbon phosphorus another distinction based size organic compound distinguishes small molecule polymer natural compound refer produced plant animal many still extracted natural source would expensive produce artificially example include sugar alkaloid terpenoids certain nutrient vitamin general natural product large stereoisometrically complicated molecule present reasonable concentration living organism further compound prime importance biochemistry antigen carbohydrate enzyme hormone lipid fatty acid neurotransmitter nucleic acid protein peptide amino acid lectin vitamin fat oil compound prepared reaction compound known synthetic they may either compound already found plants/animals artificial compound occur naturally most polymer category includes plastic rubber organic synthetic semi-synthetic compound many organic compounds—two example ethanol insulin—are manufactured industrially using organism bacteria yeast
