aeronautics science art involved study design manufacturing air flight–capable machine technique operating aircraft rocket within atmosphere the british royal aeronautical society identifies aspect aeronautical art science engineering the profession aeronautics expression includes astronautics while term originally referred solely operating aircraft since expanded include technology business aspect related aircraft the term aviation sometimes used interchangeably aeronautics although aeronautics includes lighter-than-air craft airship includes ballistic vehicle aviation technically significant part aeronautical science branch dynamic called aerodynamics deal motion air way interacts object motion aircraft attempt fly without real aeronautical understanding made earliest time typically constructing wing jumping tower crippling lethal result wiser investigator sought gain rational understanding study bird flight medieval islamic golden age scientist abbas ibn firnas also

described chinese technique current the chinese also constructed small hot air balloon lantern rotary-wing toy early european provide scientific discussion flight roger bacon described principle operation lighter-than-air balloon flapping-wing ornithopter envisaged would constructed future the lifting medium balloon would aether whose composition know late fifteenth century leonardo vinci followed study bird design earliest flying machine including flapping-wing ornithopter rotating-wing helicopter although design rational based particularly good science many design four-person screw-type helicopter severe flaw least understand object offer much resistance air air object newton would publish third law motion his analysis led realisation manpower alone sufficient sustained flight later design included mechanical power source spring vinci work lost death reappear overtaken work george cayley the modern era lighter-than-air flight began early century galileo experiment showed air weight around cyrano bergerac wrote fantasy novel described principle ascent using substance dew supposed lighter air descending releasing controlled amount substance francesco lana terzi measured pressure air sea level proposed first scientifically credible lifting medium form hollow metal sphere air pumped these would lighter displaced air able lift airship his proposed method controlling height still use today carrying ballast may dropped overboard gain height venting lifting container lose height practice terzi sphere would collapsed air pressure development wait practicable lifting gas from century montgolfier brother france began experimenting balloon their balloon made paper early experiment using steam lifting gas short-lived due effect paper condensed mistaking smoke kind steam began filling balloon hot smoky air called electric smoke despite fully understanding principle work made successful launch invited give demonstration french académie de science meanwhile discovery hydrogen led joseph black propose use lifting gas though practical demonstration awaited gas tight balloon material hearing montgolfier brother invitation french academy
