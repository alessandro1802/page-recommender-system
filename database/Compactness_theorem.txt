mathematical logic compactness theorem state set first-order sentence model every finite subset model this theorem important tool model theory provides useful generally effective method constructing model set sentence finitely consistent the compactness theorem propositional calculus consequence tychonoff theorem say product compact space compact applied compact stone space hence theorem name likewise analogous finite intersection property characterization compactness topological space collection closed set compact space non-empty intersection every finite subcollection non-empty
