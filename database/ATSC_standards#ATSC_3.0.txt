electronics hold patent atsc standard atsc includes two primary high definition video format also includes standard-definition format although initially hdtv service launched digital format atsc carry

height line the third size hdtv image scan line height pixel wide the largest size line high pixel wide video actually encoded pixel frame last eight line discarded prior display this due restriction video format requires height picture luma sample i.e pixel divisible the lower resolution operate either progressive scan interlaced mode largest picture size the system support progressive image highest frame rate frame per second technology seen advanced time the standard also requires video progressive scan since provides better picture quality interlaced scan given frame rate legacy use interlaced scan format the result combination maximum frame rate picture size result approximately number sample per second interlaced format format roughly equal similar equality relationship applies line frame per second versus line frame per second terrestrial over-the-air transmission carry megabit data per second fluctuating bandwidth mbit/s left overhead error correction program guide closed captioning etc compared maximum possible bitrate mbit/s mbit/s typical allowed dvd standard mbit/s mbit/s typical allowed blu-ray disc standard although atsc standard limit transmission format listed integer frame rate paired version u.s. federal communication commission declined mandate television station obey part atsc standard theory television station u.s. free choose resolution aspect ratio frame/field rate within limit main profile high level many station outside bound atsc specification using resolution example edtv display reproduce progressive scan content frequently wide screen format such resolution citation needed ntsc pal allowing progressive frame per second ntsc pal atsc also support pal frame rate resolution defined atsc standard the atsc specification imposes certain constraint video stream the atsc specification allow use progressive frame coded within interlaced video sequence for example nbc station transmit video sequence meaning formal output decoding process sixty field per second however prime-time television show field coded using progressive frame base actually video stream sequence progressive frame per second transmitted metadata instructs decoder interlace field perform pulldown display soft telecine the atsc specification also allows sequence however used practice broadcaster want able switch interlaced news progressive psf soap opera progressive prime-time content without ending sequence the format encoded pixel luma matrix chroma matrix last line discarded decoding display process july atsc updated support itu-t video codec the new standard split two part the new standard support frame per second frame rate require high profile level standard hdtv frame rate require level sdtv frame rate require level dubious discus the file

broadcaster must-carry rule the canadian radio-television telecommunication commission canada similar rule force respect carrying atsc signal however cable operator still slow add atsc channel lineup legal regulatory plant equipment related reason one key technical regulatory issue modulation scheme used cable cable operator u.s. lesser extent canada determine method modulation plant multiple
