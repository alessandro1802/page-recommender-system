differentiable programming programming paradigm numeric computer program differentiated throughout via automatic differentiation this allows gradient-based optimization parameter program often via gradient descent well learning approach based higher order derivative information differentiable programming found use wide variety area particularly scientific computing artificial intelligence one early proposal adopt framework systematic fashion improve upon learning algorithm made advanced concept team european space agency early most differentiable programming framework work constructing graph containing control flow data structure program attempt generally fall two group limitation earlier approach able differentiate code written suitable manner framework limiting interoperability program newer approach resolve issue constructing graph language syntax allowing arbitrary code differentiated differentiable programming applied area combining deep learning physic engine robotics solving electronic structure problem differentiable density functional theory differentiable ray tracing image processing probabilistic programming
