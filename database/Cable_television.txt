passive device called tap cable television began united state commercial business although small-scale system hobbyist the early system simply received weak broadcast channel amplified sent unshielded wire subscriber limited community adjacent community the receiving antenna would taller individual subscriber could afford thus bringing stronger signal hilly mountainous terrain would placed high elevation outset cable system served smaller community without television station could easily receive signal station city distance hilly terrain canada however community signal fertile cable market viewer wanted receive american signal rarely college town alfred new york u.s. cable system retransmitted canadian channel although early vhf television receiver could receive channel maximum number channel could broadcast one city channel either receiver time unable receive strong local signal adjacent channel without distortion there frequency gap allowed used city equipment improved twelve channel could utilized except local vhf television station broadcast local broadcast channel usable signal deemed priority technology allowed low-priority signal placed channel synchronizing blanking interval tv unable reconcile blanking interval slight change due travel medium causing ghosting the bandwidth amplifier also limited meaning frequency mhz difficult transmit distant portion coaxial network uhf channel could used expand beyond channel non-standard midband channel used located band channel superband beyond channel mhz channel initially accessible using separate tuner box sent chosen channel set channel citation needed initially uhf broadcast station disadvantage standard set use time unable receive channel with passage all-channel receiver act new television set required include uhf tuner nonetheless would still take year uhf station become competitive before added cable box midband channel used early incarnation pay e.g the channel los angeles hbo transmitted clear i.e scrambled standard set period could pick signal could average consumer de-tune normal station able receive once tuner could receive select mid-band super-band channel began incorporated standard television set broadcaster forced either install scrambling circuitry move signal range reception early cable-ready tv vcr however consumer set ability receive fcc allocated channel premium broadcaster left choice scramble unfortunately pay-tv operator descrambling circuitry often published electronics hobby magazine popular science popular electronics allowing anybody anything rudimentary knowledge broadcast electronics able build receive programming without cost later cable operator began carry radio station encouraged subscriber connect stereo set cable before stereo bilingual sound became common pay-tv channel sound added stereo cable line-ups about time operator expanded beyond dial use midband superband vhf channel adjacent high band north american television frequency some operator cornwall ontario used dual distribution network channel two cable during united state regulation unlike public educational government access peg created beginning cable-originated live television programming cable penetration increased numerous cable-only station launched many news bureau could provide immediate localized content provided nearest network newscast such station may use similar on-air branding used nearby broadcast network affiliate fact station broadcast air regulated fcc call sign meaningless these station evolved partially today over-the-air digital subchannels main broadcast station e.g nb would case local cnb ab station available rebroadcast programming nearby affiliate fill news community programming suit locale many live local program local interest subsequently created united state major television market early this evolved today many cable-only broadcast diverse programming including cable-only produced television movie miniseries cable specialty channel starting channel oriented show movie large sporting performance event diversified narrowcasting became common late cable-only signal outnumbered broadcast signal cable system time expanded beyond channel canada cable operator allowed regulator enter distribution contract cable network tier became common customer able subscribe different tier obtain different selection additional channel basic selection subscribing additional tier customer could get specialty channel movie channel foreign channel large cable company used addressable descramblers limit access premium channel customer subscribing higher tier however magazine often published workarounds technology well during pressure accommodate growing array offering resulted digital transmission made efficient use vhf signal capacity fibre optic common carry signal area near home coax could carry higher frequency short remaining distance although time television receiver vcr equipped receive mid-band super-band channel due fact descrambling circuitry time present tuner depriving cable operator much revenue cable-ready tuner rarely used requiring return set-top box used onward the conversion digital broadcasting put signal broadcast cable digital form rendering analog cable television service mostly obsolete functional ever-dwindling supply select market analog television set still accommodated tuner mostly obsolete oftentimes dependent entirely set-top box cable television mostly available north america europe australia south asia east asia south america le
