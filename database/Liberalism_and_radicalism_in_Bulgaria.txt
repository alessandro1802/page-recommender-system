It is limited to liberal and radical parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ denotes another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it is not necessary that parties label themselves as a liberal party. Liberalism was a dominant political force at the end of the nineteenth century. The current got strongly divided. After the restoration of democracy in 1990, some parties got a liberal character. Liberalism is now represented by the mainly Turkish minority party Movement for Rights and Freedoms (Dviženie za prava i svobodi, observer LI, member ELDR), the National Movement for Simeon II (Nacionalno Dviženie Simeon Vtori, member LI, ELDR) and Democratic Bulgaria (Demokratichna Balgariya), both taking a more or less liberal position.
