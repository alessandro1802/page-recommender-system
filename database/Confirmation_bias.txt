interpret ambiguous evidence supporting existing attitude the effect strongest desired outcome emotionally charged issue deeply entrenched belief confirmation bias eliminated managed example education training critical thinking skill biased search information biased interpretation information biased memory recall invoked explain four specific effect series psychological experiment suggested people biased toward confirming existing belief later work re-interpreted result tendency test idea one-sided way focusing one possibility ignoring alternative explanation observed bias include wishful thinking limited human capacity process information another proposal people show confirmation bias pragmatically assessing cost wrong rather investigating neutral scientific way flawed decision due confirmation bias found wide range political organizational financial scientific context these bias contribute overconfidence personal belief maintain strengthen belief face contrary evidence for example confirmation bias produce systematic error scientific research based inductive reasoning gradual accumulation supportive evidence similarly police detective may identify suspect early investigation may seek confirming rather disconfirming evidence medical practitioner may prematurely focus particular disorder early diagnostic session seek confirming evidence social medium confirmation bias amplified use filter bubble algorithmic editing display individual information likely agree excluding opposing view confirmation bias phrase coined english psychologist peter wason tendency people favor information confirms strengthens belief value difficult dislodge affirmed confirmation bias example cognitive bias confirmation bias confirmatory bias also termed myside bias congeniality bias also used confirmation bias effect information processing they differ sometimes called behavioral confirmation effect commonly known self-fulfilling prophecy person expectation influence behavior bringing expected result some psychologist restrict term confirmation bias selective collection evidence support one already belief ignoring rejecting evidence support different conclusion others apply term broadly tendency preserve one existing belief searching evidence interpreting recalling memory confirmation bias result automatic unintentional strategy rather deliberate deception confirmation bias avoided eliminated managed improving education critical thinking skill confirmation bias broad construct number possible explanation namely hypothesis-testing falsification hypothesis testing positive test strategy information processing explanation experiment found repeatedly people tend test hypothesis one-sided way searching evidence consistent current hypothesis rather searching relevant evidence phrase question receive affirmative answer support theory they look consequence would expect hypothesis true rather would happen false for example someone using yes/no question find number suspect number might ask odd number people prefer type question called positive test even negative test even number would yield exactly information however mean people seek test guarantee positive answer study subject could select either pseudo-tests genuinely diagnostic one favored genuinely diagnostic the preference positive test bias since positive test highly informative however combination effect strategy confirm existing belief assumption independently whether true real-world situation evidence often complex mixed for example various contradictory idea someone could supported concentrating one aspect behavior thus search evidence favor hypothesis likely succeed one illustration way phrasing question significantly change answer for example people asked are happy social life report greater satisfaction asked are unhappy social life even small change question wording affect people search available information hence conclusion reach this shown using fictional child custody case participant read parent moderately suitable guardian multiple way parent mix salient positive negative quality close relationship child job would take away long period time when asked which parent custody child majority participant chose parent looking mainly positive attribute however asked which parent denied custody child looked negative attribute majority answered parent denied custody implying parent custody similar study demonstrated people engage biased search information also phenomenon may limited preference genuine diagnostic test initial

confirmation bias repeatedly challenged participant identify rule applying triple number they told fit rule they generated triple experimenter told whether triple conformed rule the actual rule simply ascending sequence participant great difficulty finding often announcing rule far specific middle number average first last the participant seemed test positive examples—triples obeyed hypothesized rule for example thought rule each number two greater predecessor would offer triple fitted confirmed rule rather triple violated falsified wason interpreted result showing preference confirmation falsification hence coined term confirmation bias wason also used confirmation bias explain result selection task experiment participant repeatedly performed badly various form test case ignoring information could potentially refute falsify specified rule klayman paper argues wason experiment actually demonstrate bias towards confirmation instead tendency make test consistent working hypothesis they called positive test strategy this strategy example heuristic reasoning shortcut imperfect easy compute klayman used bayesian probability information theory standard hypothesis-testing rather falsificationism used wason according idea answer question yield different amount information depends person prior belief thus scientific test hypothesis one expected produce information since information content depends initial probability positive test either highly informative uninformative klayman argued people think realistic problem looking specific answer small initial probability case positive test usually informative negative test however wason rule discovery task answer—three number ascending order—is broad positive test unlikely yield informative answer klayman supported
