institute founded scientist george cowan david pine stirling colgate murray gell-mann nick metropolis herb anderson peter carruthers richard slansky all pine gell-mann scientist los alamo national laboratory originally called rio grande institute scientist sought forum conduct theoretical research outside traditional disciplinary boundary academic department government agency science budget sfi original mission disseminate notion new interdisciplinary research area called complexity theory simply complex system this new effort intended provide alternative increasing specialization founder observed science focusing synthesis across discipline idea interdisciplinary science increased popularity number independent institute department emerged whose focus emphasized similar goal the santa institute created visiting institution permanent tenured position small group resident faculty postdoctoral researcher large visitor program larger group external faculty affiliated institute located institution the motivation structure encourage active turnover idea people allowing research remain cutting edge interdisciplinary science today santa institute continues follow organizational model the institute composed several distinct group the resident faculty researcher whose primary appointment institute along omidyar fellow group postdoctoral scholar residence resident faculty make majority researcher physically present institute the external faculty group roughly affiliated researcher whose primary appointment institution typically university these individual form large distributed community scholar frequently visit institute contribute overall research program the institute applied complexity network formerly business network group private company government agency interested complex system research member business network often send representative institute meeting serve research fellow residence institute the institute science board large group eminent scholar advise institute important strategic matter this group includes number nobel prize winner the institute headed president currently evolutionary theorist david krakauer vice president science currently network ecologist jennifer dunne governed board trustee chaired katherine collins putnam investment research institute focus system commonly described complex adaptive system simply complex system recent research included study evolutionary computation metabolic ecological scaling law fundamental property city evolutionary diversification viral strain interaction conflict primate social group history language structure dynamic specie interaction including food web dynamic financial market emergence hierarchy cooperation human specie biological technological innovation historically researcher affiliated institute played role varying degree development use method studying complex system including agent-based modeling network theory computational immunology physic financial market genetic algorithm physic computation machine learning the institute also study foundational topic physic mathematics complex system using tool related discipline information theory combinatorics computational complexity theory condensed matter physic recent research area included study phase transition np-hard problem some institute accomplishment include the santa institute run number education program aimed introducing student young middle school old graduate school core idea complex system the longest running education program annual complex system summer school the cs host
