mathematics discipline involving formal language including mathematical logic computer science free variable notation symbol specifies place expression substitution may take place parameter container expression some older book use term real variable apparent variable free variable bound variable respectively the idea related placeholder symbol later replaced value wildcard character stand unspecified symbol computer programming term free variable refers variable used function neither local variable parameter function the term non-local variable often synonym context bound variable contrast variable bound specific value range value domain discourse universe this may achieved use logical quantifier variable-binding operator explicit statement allowed value variable …where \displaystyle positive integer example given next section however done variable cease independent variable value expression depends whether value truth value numerical result calculation generally element image set function note domain discourse many context understood explicit range value bound variable given may necessary specify domain order properly evaluate expression for example consider following expression variable bound logical quantifier this expression evaluates false domain \displaystyle \displaystyle real number true domain complex number the term dummy variable also sometimes used bound variable commonly general mathematics computer science confused identically named unrelated concept dummy variable used statistic commonly regression analysis before stating precise definition free variable bound variable following example perhaps make two concept clearer definition would expression free variable bound variable consequently value expression depends value nothing called could depend expression free variable bound variable consequently value expression depends value nothing called could depend expression free variable bound variable consequently value expression depends value nothing called could depend expression free variable bound variable associated logical quantifier consequently logical value expression depends value nothing called could depend more widely proof bound variable used for example following proof show square even integer divisible \displaystyle also used bound variable whole proof the following common variable-binding operator each bind variable set note many operator act function bound variable complicated context notation become awkward confusing useful switch notation make binding explicit sum differentiation variable-binding mechanism occur different context mathematics logic computer science case however purely syntactic property expression variable for section summarize syntax identifying expression tree whose leaf node variable constant function constant predicate constant whose non-leaf node logical operator this expression determined inorder traversal tree variable-binding operator logical operator occur almost every formal language binding operator take two argument variable expression applied argument produce new expression the meaning binding operator supplied semantics language concern variable binding relates three thing variable location variable expression non-leaf node form note define location expression leaf node syntax tree variable binding occurs location node lambda calculus bound variable term free variable term say bound free contains subterm rebound term this nested inner binding said shadow outer binding occurrence free occurrence new variable bound top level program technically free variable within term bound often treated specially compiled fixed address similarly identifier bound recursive function also technically free variable within body treated specially closed term one containing free variable give example mathematics consider expression defines function expression may contain none may contain variable case say function definition bind variable manner function definition expression kind shown thought variable binding operator analogous lambda expression lambda calculus other binding operator like summation sign thought higher-order function applying function example expression could treated notation \displaystyle \sum operator two parameters—a one-parameter function set evaluate function the operator listed expressed similar way example universal quantifier \displaystyle \forall x\in thought operator evaluates logical conjunction boolean-valued function applied possibly infinite set when analyzed formal semantics natural language seen free bound variable english personal pronoun like etc act free variable sentence possessive pronoun free variable may refer previously mentioned lisa female word book could referring lisa book instance coreference book belongs different female e.g jane book whoever referent established according situational i.e pragmatic context the identity referent shown using coindexing subscript indicates one referent indicates second referent different thus sentence lisa found book following interpretation the distinction purely academic interest language actually different form heri herj example norwegian swedish translate coreferent heri sin noncoreferent herj hennes english allow specifying coreference optional interpretation previous example valid ungrammatical interpretation indicated asterisk however reflexive pronoun etc. reciprocal pronoun act bound variable sentence like following reflexive refer previously mentioned antecedent case jane never refer different female person example variable bound noun jane occurs subject position indicating coindexation first interpretation jane coindexed permissible interpretation coindexed ungrammatical note coreference binding represented using lambda expression mentioned previous formal explanation section the sentence reflexive could represented jane subject referent argument λx.x hurt predicate function lambda abstraction lambda notation indicating semantic subject semantic object sentence bound this return semantic interpretation jane hurt jane jane person pronoun also behave different way sentence pronoun refer female ashley this mean never reflexive meaning equivalent ashley hit the grammatical ungrammatical interpretation the first interpretation impossible only second interpretation permitted grammar thus seen reflexive reciprocal bound variable known technically anaphor true pronoun free variable grammatical structure variable bound grammatical structure the binding phenomenon found natural language particularly important syntactic government binding theory see also binding linguistics
