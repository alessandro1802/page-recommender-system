civil engineer professor emeritus catholic university america his research hydrodynamics kao met future wife gwen may-wan kao née wong 黃美芸 london graduation worked together engineer standard telephone cable unreliable source she british chinese they married london son daughter reside work silicon valley california unreliable source according kao autobiography kao catholic attended catholic church wife attended anglican communion standard telecommunication laboratory stl based harlow essex england kao coworkers pioneering work creating fiber optic telecommunication medium demonstrating high-loss existing fiber optic arose impurity glass rather underlying problem technology kao first joined optical communication research team made note summarising background situation available technology time identifying key individual involved initially kao worked team antoni karbowiak toni karbowiak working alec reef study optical waveguide communication kao task investigate fiber attenuation collected sample different fiber manufacturer also investigated property bulk glass carefully kao study primarily convinced impurity material caused high light loss fiber later year kao appointed head electro-optics research group stl took optical communication program stl december supervisor karbowiak left take chair communication school electrical engineering university new south wale unsw sydney australia although kao succeeded karbowiak manager optical communication research immediately decided abandon karbowiak plan thin-film waveguide overall change research direction colleague george hockham they considered optical physic also material property the result first presented kao iee january london published july george hockham worked kao this study first theorized proposed use glass fiber implement optical communication idea especially structural feature material described largely basis today optical fiber communication citation needed what kao harlow transformed world provided backbone internet father fiber optic —harlow museum david devine kao pioneering work fiber optic stc standard telecommunication laboratory harlow kao hockham concluded fundamental limitation glass light attenuation db/km decibel per kilometer measure attenuation signal distance key threshold value optical communication however time determination optical fiber commonly exhibited light loss high db/km even this conclusion opened intense race find low-loss material suitable fibre reaching criterion citation needed kao together new team member including davy jones wright pursued goal testing various material they precisely measured attenuation light different wavelength glass material during period kao pointed high purity fused silica made ideal candidate optical communication kao also stated impurity glass material main cause dramatic decay light transmission inside glass fiber rather fundamental physical effect scattering many physicist thought time impurity could removed this led worldwide study production high-purity glass fiber when kao first proposed glass fiber could used long-distance information transfer could replace copper wire used telecommunication era idea widely disbelieved later people realized kao idea revolutionized whole communication technology industry also played leading role early stage engineering commercial realization optical communication spring kao traveled u.s. failed interest bell lab competitor stl communication technology time subsequently traveled japan gained support kao visited many glass polymer factory discussed various people including engineer scientist businessmen technique improvement glass fiber manufacture kao jones measured intrinsic loss bulk-fused silica db/km first evidence ultra-transparent glass bell lab started considering fiber optic seriously fiber optic loss bulk intrinsic source low db/km wavelength kao developed important technique configuration glass fiber waveguide contributed development different fiber type system device met civil military application requirement peripheral supporting system optical fiber communication seminal work glass fiber fatigue strength when named first itt executive scientist kao launched terabit technology program addressing high frequency limit signal processing kao also known father terabit technology concept kao published paper granted patent including water-resistant high-strength fiber maklad early stage developing optic fiber kao already strongly preferred single-mode long-distance optical communication instead using multi-mode system his vision later followed applied almost exclusively kao also visionary modern submarine communication cable largely promoted idea predicted world sea would littered fiber optic five year ahead time trans-oceanic fiber-optic cable first became serviceable ali javan introduction steady helium–neon laser kao discovery fiber light-loss property recognized two essential milestone development fiber-optic communication kao joined chinese university hong kong cuhk found department electronics later became department electronic engineering during period kao
