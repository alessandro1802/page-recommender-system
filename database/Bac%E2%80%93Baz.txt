The main page for this endeavor is at Wikipedia:Sound/list.  If you would like to help expand and improve this list, and integrate it with other Wikipedia articles, please visit the free music taskforce.  This is an incomplete list of free-content musical works available on Wikimedia Commons, with special emphasis on works that are (or maybe should be) linked in Wikipedia articles. This list alphabetically covers people on the list of composers by name, having last names beginning with "Bacâ€“Baz". In music, an "arrangement" is a musical reconceptualization of a previously composed work, and when such audio files are listed here they are listed by composer instead of by arranger.  Most of the files listed here only contain audio, but some contain both audio and video. You can alphabetically sort each column by clicking on the small box at the top of that column (click again to sort reverse-alphabetically).  If you have trouble playing ogg files, see Wikipedia:Media help (Ogg).  To select the contents of a column, hold down Ctrl while selecting the column you want, and you may also use the Shift key; this works in Mozilla, SeaMonkey, and Firefox. NOTE: Don't forget that if you right-click on any link below, then that will open a new window, and so you will be able to come back to this list without having to re-load it.  This list loads slooooooowly because the icons load sloooooowly (the icons are needed because otherwise the "flac" files will not play). earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier  earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier  earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier  earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier
