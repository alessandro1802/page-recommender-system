include peak–end rule focusing illusion nearness bias future bias the peak–end rule affect remember pleasantness unpleasantness experience state overall impression past event determined part total pleasure suffering contained felt peak end for example memory painful colonoscopy improved examination extended three minute scope still inside moved anymore resulting moderately uncomfortable sensation this extended colonoscopy despite involving pain overall remembered le negatively due reduced pain end this even increase likelihood patient return subsequent procedure daniel kahneman explains distortion term difference two self experiencing self aware pleasure pain happening remembering self show aggregate pleasure pain extended period time the distortion due peak–end rule happen level remembering self our tendency rely remembering self often lead pursue course action best self-interest closely related bias focusing illusion the illusion occurs people consider impact one specific factor overall happiness they tend greatly exaggerate importance factor overlooking numerous factor would case greater impact the nearness bias future bias two different form violating principle temporal neutrality this principle state temporal location benefit harm important normative significance rational agent care extent part life the nearness bias also discussed label present
