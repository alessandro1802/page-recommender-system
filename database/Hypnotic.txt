hypnotic greek hypnos sleep soporific drug commonly known sleeping pill class umbrella term psychoactive drug whose primary function induce sleep surgical anesthesia note treat insomnia sleeplessness this group drug related sedative whereas term sedative describes drug serve calm relieve anxiety term hypnotic generally describes drug whose main purpose initiate sustain lengthen sleep because two function frequently overlap drug class generally produce dose-dependent effect ranging anxiolysis loss consciousness often referred collectively sedative-hypnotic drug hypnotic drug regularly prescribed insomnia sleep disorder insomnia patient prescribed hypnotic country many hypnotic drug habit-forming and—due many factor known disturb human sleep pattern—a physician may instead recommend change environment sleep better sleep hygiene avoidance caffeine alcohol stimulating substance behavioral intervention cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia cbt-i prescribing medication sleep when prescribed hypnotic medication used shortest period time necessary among individual sleep disorder taking prescribed nonbenzodiazepines taking benzodiazepine usa early class drug barbiturate fallen use practice still prescribed patient child prescribing hypnotic yet acceptable—unless used treat night terror sleepwalking elderly people sensitive potential side effect daytime fatigue cognitive impairment meta-analysis found risk generally outweigh marginal benefit hypnotic elderly review literature regarding benzodiazepine hypnotic z-drugs concluded drug adverse effect dependence accident optimal treatment us lowest effective dose shortest therapeutic time period gradual discontinuation order improve health without worsening sleep falling outside above-mentioned category neurohormone melatonin analogue ramelteon serve hypnotic function hypnotica class somniferous drug substance tested medicine later these include urethan acetal methylal sulfonal paraldehyde amylenhydrate hypnon chloralurethan ohloralamid chloralimid research using medication treat insomnia evolved throughout last half century treatment insomnia psychiatry date back chloral hydrate first used soporific barbiturate emerged first class drug early chemical substitution allowed derivative compound although best drug family time le toxicity fewer side effect dangerous overdose tended cause physical psychological dependence during quinazolinones benzodiazepine introduced safer alternative replace barbiturate late benzodiazepine emerged safer drug benzodiazepine without drawback substance dependence possible death overdoses sometimes occur especially combination alcohol and/or depressant question raised whether disturb sleep architecture nonbenzodiazepines recent development although clear le toxic barbiturate predecessor comparative efficacy benzodiazepine established such efficacy hard determine without longitudinal study however psychiatrist recommend drug citing research suggesting equally potent le potential abuse other sleep remedy may considered sedative-hypnotic exist psychiatrist sometimes prescribe medicine off-label sedating effect example include mirtazapine antidepressant clonidine older antihypertensive drug quetiapine antipsychotic over-the-counter allergy antiemetic medication doxylamine diphenhydramine off-label sleep remedy particularly useful first-line treatment unsuccessful deemed unsafe patient history substance abuse barbiturate drug act central nervous system depressant therefore produce wide spectrum effect mild sedation total anesthesia they also effective anxiolytic hypnotic anticonvulsalgesic effect however effect somewhat weak preventing barbiturate used surgery absence analgesic they dependence liability physical psychological barbiturate largely replaced benzodiazepine routine medical practice treatment anxiety insomnia mainly benzodiazepine significantly le dangerous overdose however barbiturate still used general anesthesia epilepsy assisted suicide barbiturate derivative barbituric acid the principal mechanism action barbiturate believed positive allosteric modulation gabaa receptor example include amobarbital pentobarbital phenobarbital secobarbital sodium thiopental quinazolinones also class drug function hypnotic/sedatives contain core their use also proposed treatment cancer example quinazolinones include cloroqualone diproqualone etaqualone aolan athinazone ethinazone mebroqualone afloqualone arofuto mecloqualone nubarene casfen methaqualone quaalude benzodiazepine useful short-term treatment insomnia their use beyond week recommended due risk dependence preferred benzodiazepine taken intermittently—and lowest effective dose they improve sleep-related problem shortening time spent bed falling asleep prolonging sleep time general reducing wakefulness like alcohol benzodiazepine commonly used treat insomnia short-term prescribed self-medicated worsen sleep long-term while benzodiazepine put people sleep i.e. inhibit nrem stage sleep asleep drug disrupt sleep architecture decreasing sleep time delaying time rem sleep decreasing deep slow-wave sleep restorative part sleep energy mood other drawback hypnotic including benzodiazepine possible tolerance effect rebound insomnia reduced slow-wave sleep withdrawal period typified rebound insomnia prolonged period anxiety agitation the list benzodiazepine approved treatment insomnia fairly similar among country benzodiazepine officially designated first-line hypnotic prescribed treatment insomnia vary distinctly country longer-acting benzodiazepine nitrazepam diazepam residual effect may persist next day general recommended clear whether new nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic z-drugs better short-acting benzodiazepine the efficacy two group medication similar according agency healthcare research quality indirect comparison indicates side-effects benzodiazepine may twice frequent nonbenzodiazepines some expert suggest using nonbenzodiazepines preferentially first-line long-term treatment insomnia however national institute health clinical excellence nice find convincing evidence favor z-drugs nice review pointed short-acting z-drugs inappropriately compared clinical trial long-acting benzodiazepine there trial comparing short-acting z-drugs appropriate dos short-acting benzodiazepine based nice recommended choosing hypnotic based cost patient preference older adult use benzodiazepine treat insomnia—unless treatment failed effective when benzodiazepine used patient caretaker physician discus increased risk harm including evidence show twice incidence traffic collision among driving patient well fall hip fracture older patient their mechanism action primarily gabaa receptor nonbenzodiazepines class psychoactive drug benzodiazepine-like nature nonbenzodiazepine pharmacodynamics almost entirely benzodiazepine drug therefore entail similar benefit side-effects risk nonbenzodiazepines however dissimilar entirely different chemical structure therefore unrelated benzodiazepine molecular level example include zopiclone imovane zimovane eszopiclone lunesta zaleplon sonata zolpidem ambien stilnox stilnoct research nonbenzodiazepines new conflicting review team researcher suggests use drug people trouble falling asleep staying asleep note next-day impairment minimal the team noted safety drug established called research long-term effectiveness treating insomnia other evidence suggests tolerance nonbenzodiazepines may slower develop benzodiazepine failed verification different team skeptical finding little benefit benzodiazepine melatonin hormone produced pineal gland brain secreted dim light darkness among function promotes sleep diurnal mammal ramelteon tasimelteon synthetic analogue melatonin also used sleep-related indication common use term antihistamine refers compound inhibit action receptor etc. clinically antagonist used treat certain allergy sedation common side-effect antagonist diphenhydramine benadryl doxylamine also used treat insomnia second-generation antihistamine cross blood–brain barrier much lower degree first one medical citation needed this result primarily affecting peripheral histamine receptor therefore much lower sedative effect high dos still induce central nervous system effect drowsiness some antidepressant sedating effect example include while drug frequently prescribed insomnia use recommended unless insomnia due underlying mental health condition treatable antipsychotic risk frequently outweigh benefit some serious adverse effect observed occur low dos used off-label prescribing dyslipidemia neutropenia recent network meta-analysis double-blind randomized controlled trial drug therapy vs. placebo insomnia adult found quetiapine demonstrated short-term benefit sleep quality example antipsychotic sedation side effect occasionally used insomnia major systematic review network meta-analysis medication treatment insomnia published found wide range effect size standardized mean difference smd term efficacy insomnia the assessed medication included benzodiazepine smds z-drugs smds sedative antidepressant antihistamine smds quetiapine smd orexin receptor antagonist smds melatonin receptor agonist smds the certainty evidence varied ranged high low depending medication the use sedative medication older people generally avoided these medication associated poorer health outcome including cognitive decline therefore sedative hypnotic avoided people dementia according clinical guideline known medication appropriateness tool comorbid health condition dementia match-d the use medication impede cognitive function people dementia also sensitive side effect medication
