mathematical logic tautology greek ταυτολογία formula assertion true every possible interpretation example x=y x≠y similarly either ball green ball green always true regardless colour ball the philosopher ludwig wittgenstein first applied term redundancy propositional logic borrowing rhetoric tautology repetitive statement logic formula satisfiable true least one interpretation thus tautology formula whose negation unsatisfiable word false untrue unsatisfiable statement negation affirmation known formally contradiction formula neither tautology contradiction said logically contingent such formula made either true false based value assigned propositional variable the double turnstile notation \displaystyle \vdash used indicate tautology tautology sometimes symbolized vpq contradiction opq the tee symbol \displaystyle \top sometimes used denote arbitrary tautology dual symbol \displaystyle \bot falsum representing arbitrary contradiction symbolism tautology may substituted truth value true symbolized instance tautology key concept propositional logic tautology defined propositional formula true possible boolean valuation propositional variable key property tautology propositional logic effective method exists testing whether given formula always satisfied equiv. whether negation unsatisfiable the definition tautology extended sentence predicate logic may contain quantifiers—a feature absent sentence propositional logic the word tautology used ancient greek describe statement asserted true merely virtue saying thing twice pejorative meaning still used rhetorical tautology between word gained new meaning logic currently used mathematical logic denote certain type propositional formula without pejorative connotation originally possessed immanuel kant wrote book logic the identity concept analytical judgment either explicit explicita non-explicit implicita former case analytic proposition tautological.here analytic proposition refers analytic truth statement natural language true solely term involved gottlob frege proposed grundlagen truth analytic exactly derived using logic however maintained distinction analytic truth i.e. truth based meaning term tautology i.e. statement devoid content tractatus logico-philosophicus ludwig wittgenstein proposed statement deduced logical deduction tautological empty meaning well analytic truth henri poincaré made similar remark science hypothesis although bertrand russell first argued remark wittgenstein poincaré claiming mathematical truth non-tautologous synthetic later spoke favor everything proposition logic got sense like tautology got something peculiar quality know define belongs logical proposition others.here logical proposition refers proposition provable using law logic during formalization semantics propositional logic term truth assignment developed the term tautology began applied propositional formula true regardless truth falsity propositional variable some early book logic symbolic logic lewis langford used term proposition formal logic universally valid common presentation stephen kleene herbert enderton use tautology refer logically valid propositional formula maintain distinction tautology logically valid context first-order logic see propositional logic begin propositional variable atomic unit represent concrete proposition formula consists propositional variable connected logical connective built way truth overall formula deduced truth falsity variable valuation function assigns propositional variable either truth falsity using propositional variable binary connective \displaystyle \lor \displaystyle \land representing disjunction conjunction respectively unary connective \displaystyle \lnot representing negation following formula obtained \displaystyle a\land \lor \lnot \lor \lnot valuation must assign either but matter assignment made overall formula come true for first conjunction \displaystyle a\land satisfied particular valuation one assigned make one following disjunct assigned formula propositional logic tautology formula always true regardless valuation used propositional variable there infinitely many tautology example include minimal tautology tautology instance shorter tautology the problem determining whether formula tautology fundamental propositional logic variable occurring formula distinct valuation formula therefore task determining whether formula tautology finite mechanical one one need evaluate truth value formula possible valuation one algorithmic method verifying every valuation make formula true make truth table includes every possible valuation for example consider formula there possible valuation propositional variable represented first three column following table the remaining column show truth subformulas formula culminating column showing truth value original formula valuation because row final column show sentence question verified tautology also possible define deductive system i.e. proof system propositional logic simpler variant deductive system employed first-order logic see kleene sec one system proof tautology appropriate deduction system may much shorter complete truth table formula propositional variable requires truth table line quickly becomes infeasible increase proof system also required study intuitionistic propositional logic method truth table employed law excluded middle assumed formula said tautologically imply formula every valuation cause true also cause true this situation denoted \displaystyle r\models equivalent formula \displaystyle r\to tautology kleene for example let \displaystyle \displaystyle a\land b\lor \lnot then \displaystyle tautology valuation make \displaystyle false make \displaystyle false but valuation make \displaystyle true make \displaystyle true \displaystyle b\lor \lnot tautology let \displaystyle formula \displaystyle a\land then \displaystyle r\models valuation satisfying \displaystyle make \displaystyle true—and thus make \displaystyle true follows definition formula \displaystyle contradiction \displaystyle tautologically implies every formula truth valuation cause \displaystyle true definition tautological implication trivially satisfied similarly \displaystyle tautology \displaystyle tautologically implied every formula there general procedure substitution rule allows additional tautology constructed given tautology kleene sec suppose tautology propositional variable fixed sentence chosen then sentence obtained replacing variable corresponding sentence also tautology for example let tautology let \displaystyle c\lor let \displaystyle c\to follows substitution rule sentence axiomatic system complete every tautology theorem derivable axiom axiomatic system sound every theorem tautology the problem constructing practical algorithm determine whether sentence large number propositional variable tautology area contemporary research area automated theorem proving the method truth table illustrated provably correct truth table tautology end column truth table sentence tautology contain row whose final column valuation corresponding row valuation satisfy sentence tested this method verifying tautology effective procedure mean given unlimited computational resource always used mechanistically determine whether sentence tautology this mean particular set tautology fixed finite countable alphabet decidable set efficient procedure however truth table constrained fact number valuation must checked increase number variable formula this exponential growth computation length render truth table method useless formula thousand propositional variable contemporary computing hardware execute algorithm feasible time period the problem determining whether valuation make formula true boolean satisfiability problem problem checking tautology equivalent problem verifying sentence tautology equivalent verifying valuation satisfying \displaystyle \lnot known boolean satisfiability problem complete widely believed polynomial-time algorithm perform consequently tautology co-np-complete current research focus finding algorithm perform well special class formula terminate quickly average even though input may cause take much longer the fundamental definition tautology context propositional logic the definition extended however sentence first-order logic these sentence may contain quantifier unlike sentence propositional logic context first-order logic distinction maintained logical validity sentence true every model tautology tautological validity proper subset first-order logical validity context propositional logic two term coincide tautology first-order logic sentence obtained taking tautology propositional logic uniformly replacing propositional variable first-order formula one formula per propositional variable for example \displaystyle a\lor \lnot tautology propositional logic \displaystyle \forall x=x \lor \lnot \forall x=x tautology first order logic similarly first-order language unary relation symbol following sentence tautology obtained replacing \displaystyle \displaystyle \exists xrx \displaystyle \displaystyle \lnot \exists xsx \displaystyle \displaystyle \forall xtx propositional tautology \displaystyle a\land \to \leftrightarrow a\to b\to not logical validity tautology first-order logic for example sentence true first-order interpretation corresponds propositional sentence \displaystyle a\to tautology propositional logic
