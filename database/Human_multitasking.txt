human multitasking concept one split attention one task activity time speaking phone driving car multitasking result time wasted due human context switching becoming prone error due insufficient attention one becomes proficient two task possible rapidly shift attention task perform task well the first published use word multitask appeared ibm paper describing capability ibm the term since applied human task since psychologist conducted experiment nature limit human multitasking the simplest experimental design used investigate human multitasking so-called psychological refractory period effect here people asked make separate response two stimulus presented close together time extremely general finding slowing response second-appearing stimulus researcher long suggested appears processing bottleneck preventing brain working certain key aspect task time e.g. gladstone regan lee pashler bottlenecking refers idea people limited amount attentional resource important information kept many researcher believe cognitive function subject severe form bottlenecking planning action retrieval information memory psychiatrist edward hallowell gone far describe multitasking mythical activity people believe perform two task simultaneously effectively one others researched multitasking area learning richard mayer moreno studied phenomenon cognitive load multimedia learning concluded difficult impossible learn new information engaging multitasking reynol junco shelia cotten examined multitasking affect academic success found student engaged high level multitasking reported significant issue academic work recent study effect multitasking academic performance showed using facebook text messaging studying negatively related student grade online searching emailing some experiment done demonstrate possible divide one attention among several task successfully depends several factor much practice one difficulty task walter schneider robert shiffrin performed experiment presented participant memory set consists target stimulus number three after presented memory set rapidly shown test frame contained distractor stimulus one slide shown contained one target stimulus memory set with trial new memory set new test frame presented start experiment participant averaged correctly identifying target stimulus memory set after trial participant able bring average they reported trial task became automatic able respond without thinking because brain fully focus multitasking people take longer complete task predisposed error when people attempt complete many task one time alternate rapidly error way take far longer—often double time more—to get job done done sequentially state meyer this largely brain compelled restart refocus study meyer david kieras found interim exchange brain make progress whatsoever therefore multitasking people perform task le suitably lose time process according study done jordan grafman chief cognitive neuroscience section national institute neurological disorder stroke anterior part brain allows person leave something incomplete return place continue brodmann area part brain frontal lobe important establishing attaining long-term goal focusing multiple dissimilar task force brain process activity anterior though brain complex perform myriad task multitask well another study rené marois psychologist vanderbilt university discovered brain exhibit response selection bottleneck asked perform several task the brain must decide activity important thereby taking time psychologist david meyer university michigan claim instead bottleneck brain experience adaptive executive control place priority activity these viewpoint differ bottlenecking attempt force many thought brain adaptive executive control prioritizes task maintain semblance order the brain better understands order psychologist dr. meyer believe therefore trained multitask known exactly brain process input reacts overstimulation some research suggests human brain trained multitask study published child development monica luciana associate professor psychology university minnesota discovered brain capability categorizing competing information continues develop age sixteen seventeen study vanderbilt university found multitasking largely limited speed prefrontal cortex process information paul dux co-author study belief process become faster proper training the study trained seven people perform two simple task either separately together conducted brain scan participant the individual multitasked poorly first training able adeptly perform task simultaneously brain scan participant indicate prefrontal cortex quickened ability process information enabling individual multitask efficiently however study also suggests brain incapable performing multiple task one time even extensive training this study indicates brain become adept processing responding certain information truly multitask people limited ability retain information worsens amount information increase for reason people alter information make memorable separating ten-digit phone number three smaller group dividing alphabet set three five letter phenomenon known chunking george miller former psychologist harvard university belief limit human brain capacity center around number seven plus minus two illustrative example test person must repeat number read aloud while two three number easily repeated fifteen number become difficult the person would average repeat seven correctly brain capable storing limited amount information short-term memory laboratory-based study multi-tasking indicate one motivation switching task increase time spent task produce reward payne duggan neth this reward could progress towards overall task goal could simply opportunity pursue interesting fun activity payne duggan neth found decision switch task reflected either reward provided current task availability suitable opportunity switch i.e completion subgoal french fmri study published indicated preliminary support hypothesis brain pursue two goal simultaneously one frontal lobe goal-oriented area when studying cost multitasking typically two design type multitasking examined task switching dual tasking task switching involves shifting one attention one thing another dual tasking hand attention divided among multiple thing study done specifically examine brain one engaged either type multitasking through use mri brain scan researcher found frontoparietal region activated would include inferior frontal junction posterior parietal cortex they also found type tasking us different mechanism also underlying mechanism resource share there little data available support claim real sex difference most study show sex difference tend

technology foster multitasking promotes multiple source input given time instead exchanging old equipment like print music new equipment computer internet video game child teen combine form medium continually increase source input according study kaiser family foundation percent time spent using medium internet television video game telephone text-messaging e-mail combined percent time medium used together this increase simultaneous medium usage decrease amount attention paid device found percent american youth use internet seventh grade school survey kaiser family foundation found usage medium continued constant hour per day american age crowding roughly hour worth medium day due multitasking the survey showed one quarter one-third participant one input time watching television listening music reading the harvard business review featured linda stone idea continuous partial attention constantly scanning opportunity staying top contact event activity effort miss nothing technology provides distraction attention spread among task thinly prevalent example inattention detail due multitasking apparent people talk cell phone driving one study found accident four time likely using cell phone driving another study compared reaction time experienced driver number task found subject reacted slowly brake light stop sign phone conversation simultaneous task study showed driver talking cell phone involved rear-end collision sped slower intoxicated driver when talking people must withdraw attention road order formulate response because brain focus two source input one time driving listening talking constantly changing input provided cell phone distracts brain increase likelihood accident scientific study found small percent population appeared much better multitasking others people subsequently labeled supertaskers another study supported idea supertaskers this particular study showed tested people making drive driving simulator time memorizing word solving math problem expected participant much worse individual task test score the supertaskers however able multitask without major effect performance barry schwartz noted given media-rich landscape internet era tempting get habit dwelling constant sea information many choice noted negative effect human happiness observer youth modern society often comment upon apparently advanced multitasking capability youngest generation human generation generation while true contemporary researcher find youth today world exhibit high level multitasking expert believe member net generation better
