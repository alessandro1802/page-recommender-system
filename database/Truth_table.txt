truth table mathematical table used logic—specifically connection boolean algebra boolean function propositional calculus—which set functional value logical expression functional argument combination value taken logical variable particular truth table used show whether propositional expression true legitimate input value logically valid truth table one column input variable example one final column showing possible result logical operation table represents example xor each row truth table contains one possible configuration input variable instance p=true q=false result operation value see example clarification ludwig wittgenstein generally credited inventing popularizing truth table tractatus logico-philosophicus completed published such system also independently proposed emil leon post even earlier iteration truth table also found unpublished manuscript charles sander peirce antedating publication nearly year there unary operation the output value always true regardless input value the output value never true always false regardless input value logical identity operation one logical value output value remains the truth table logical identity operator follows logical negation operation one logical value typically value proposition produce value true operand false value false operand true the truth table not also written fpq follows there possible truth function two binary variable here extended truth table giving definition sixteen possible truth function two boolean variable note the four combination input value read row table the output function combination read row table key the following table oriented column rather row there four column rather four row display four combination input there row key one row binary function two binary variable for example row key value converse nonimplication \displaystyle \nleftarrow solely column denoted unique combination p=f q=t row value \displaystyle \nleftarrow operation three remaining column the output row \displaystyle \nleftarrow thus key logical operator also visualized using venn diagram logical conjunction operation two logical value typically value two proposition produce value true operand true the truth table and also written kpq \displaystyle \cdot follows ordinary language term true conjunction true for assignment logical value conjunction false also said otherwise logical disjunction operation two logical value typically value two proposition produce value true least one operand true the truth table also written apq follows stated english otherwise logical implication material conditional associated operation two logical value typically value two proposition produce value false first operand true second operand false value true otherwise the truth table associated logical implication implies symbolized rarely cpq follows the truth table associated material conditional symbolized follows may also useful note equivalent logical equality also known biconditional exclusive operation two logical value typically value two proposition produce value true operand false operand true the truth table xnor also written epq follows true truth value true false false different truth value exclusive disjunction operation two logical value typically value two proposition produce value true one operand true the truth table xor also written jpq follows for two proposition xor also written the logical nand operation two logical value typically value two proposition produce value false operand true word produce value true least one operand false the truth table nand also written dpq follows frequently useful express logical operation compound operation operation built composed operation many composition possible depending operation taken basic primitive operation taken composite derivative case logical nand clearly expressible compound not and the negation conjunction disjunction negation tabulated follows the logical nor operation two logical value typically value two proposition produce value true operand false word produce value false least one operand true also known peirce arrow inventor charles sander peirce sole sufficient operator the truth table nor also written xpq follows the negation disjunction conjunction negation tabulated follows inspection tabular derivation nand nor assignment logical value functional argument produce identical pattern functional value thus first second expression pair logically equivalent may substituted context pertain solely logical value this equivalence one morgan law input variable possible combination truth value given function may produce true false combination number different function variable double exponential truth table function three variable rarely given truth table used prove many logical equivalence for example consider following truth table this demonstrates fact \displaystyle p\rightarrow logically equivalent \displaystyle \lnot p\lor here truth table give definition commonly used possible truth function two boolean variable mean true mean false for binary operator condensed form truth table also used row heading column heading specify operand table cell specify result for example boolean logic us condensed truth table notation this notation useful especially operation commutative although one additionally specify row first operand column second operand this condensed notation particularly useful discussing multi-valued extension logic significantly cut combinatoric explosion number row otherwise needed also provides quickly recognizable characteristic shape distribution value table assist reader grasping rule quickly truth table also used specify function hardware look-up table luts digital logic circuitry for n-input lut truth table value row tabular format completely specifying boolean function lut representing boolean value bit binary number truth table value efficiently encoded integer value electronic design automation eda software for example integer encode truth table lut input when using integer representation truth table output value lut obtained calculating bit index based input value lut case lut output value kth bit integer for example evaluate output value lut given array boolean input value bit index truth table output value computed follows ith input true let \displaystyle else let \displaystyle then kth bit binary representation truth table lut output value \displaystyle k=v_ \times +v_ \times +v_ \times +\dots +v_ \times truth table simple straightforward way encode boolean function however given exponential growth size number input increase suitable function large number input other representation memory efficient text equation binary decision diagram digital electronics computer science field applied logic engineering mathematics truth table used reduce basic boolean operation simple correlation input output without use logic gate code for example binary addition represented truth table this truth table read left right note table describe logic operation necessary implement operation rather simply specifies function input output value with respect result example may arithmetically viewed modulo binary addition logically equivalent exclusive-or exclusive disjunction binary logic operation case used simple input output however number type value one input increase size truth table increase for instance addition operation one need two operand each one two value zero one the number combination two value four result four possible output one use base size would increase nine possible output the first addition example called half-adder full-adder carry previous operation provided input next adder thus truth table eight row would needed
