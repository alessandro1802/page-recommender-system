Google Quick Search Box (GQSB) is an application launcher and desktop search tool developed by Google for Mac OS X computers.  It allows users to search files, URLs, and contacts on their computer, as well as performing actions on the results. GQSB was first released as a developer preview on January 12, 2009.[2]  It is still in beta, and a new version is released approximately monthly.  The releases follow the sequence of chemical elements from the periodic table.  The first public release was named Scandium and As of AugustÂ 2009[update] the current release is Cobalt.[3]  Like other Google products such as the Chrome browser, QSB is open-source software.  However, just as with Chrome, Google distributes official builds with extra functionality.  In the case of QSB, this includes plugin validation, auto-update, and Google-branded icons. Later it became a fully open source product, and just called Quick Search Box.[4] In Mac OS X Snow Leopard, QSB has replaced Google Desktop. QSB is similar to another Google product, Google Desktop.  However, there are several key differences between the two products: In addition to file search, QSB is distributed with a suite of plugins that allow additional functionality.  These include: Users have noted that the functionality as compared to Desktop is reduced, especially in the area of in-document text searching, Gmail message searching and web history searching.[citation needed]
