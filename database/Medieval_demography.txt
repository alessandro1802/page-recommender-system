medieval demography study human demography europe mediterranean middle age estimate seek explain number people alive medieval period population trend life expectancy family structure related issue demography considered crucial element historical change throughout middle age the population europe remained low level early middle age boomed high middle age reached peak around number calamity caused steep decline nature historian debated population level began recover around late century gaining momentum early century the science medieval demography relies various line evidence administrative record will type record archaeological field data economic data written history because data often incomplete and/or ambiguous significant disagreement among medieval demographer the population level europe middle age roughly categorized late antiquity saw various indicator roman civilization beginning decline including urbanization seaborne commerce total population only many mediterranean shipwreck found century during period intermittent appearance plague population roman empire ranged high low million followed fairly good recovery previous high early empire serious gradual depopulation began west century east due appearance bubonic plague year economic growth trouble afflicted empire proximate cause population decrease include antonine plague plague cyprian crisis third century european population probably reached minimum extreme weather event ensuing plague justinian some connected demographic transition migration period pessimum clarification needed decrease global temperature impaired agricultural yield major plague epidemic struck mediterranean much europe century the early middle age saw relatively little population growth urbanization well roman peak reflecting low technological level limited trade political social economic dislocation exacerbated impact viking expansion north arab expansion south movement slav bulgarian later magyar

population expansion resettlement occurred europe time reason expansion colonization include improving climate known medieval warm period resulted longer productive growing season end raid viking arab magyar resulting greater political stability advancement medieval technology allowing land farmed reform church increased social stability rise feudalism also brought measure social stability town trade revived rise money economy began weaken bond serfdom tied peasant land land first plentiful labour clear work land scarce lord owned land found new way attract keep labour urban centre able attract serf promise freedom new region settled internally externally population naturally increased overall population europe estimated reached peak many million century frontier settled cultivation ceased expand internal colonization coming end population level remained high then series events—sometimes called crisis late middle ages—collectively killed million starting great famine black death population europe fell abruptly the period saw heaviest loss part germany named inhabitant disappeared the population provence reportedly halved part tuscany lost period historian struggled explain many died some questioned long-standing theory decline population caused infectious disease see discussion black death historian examined social factor follows classic malthusian argument put forward europe overpopulated even good time barely able feed population grain yield century mean every seed planted harvested modern grain yield malnutrition developed gradually decade lowering resistance disease competition resource meant warfare finally crop yield pushed little ice age alternative theory competition resource exacerbated imbalance property-owners worker money supply ceased keep fixed increased economic activity commodity money based principally silver wage sank rent rose leading demographic stagnation the economic condition poor also aggravated calamity plague recourse fleeing villa country manner noble decameron the poor lived crowded condition could isolate sick weaker immunity deficient diet difficult living working condition poor sanitation after plague exogenous cause population decline lowered labor supply wage increased this increased mobility labour led redistribution wealth although property-owners attempt resist change wage freeze price control contributed popular uprising peasant revolt total population europe substantially year earlier class overall higher standard living still yet another theory introduced robert brenner paper economic system high middle age limited population growth feudal lord landlord controlled europe land could charge high enough rent demand large enough percentage peasant profit peasant land forced survive subsistence level with surplus food labor income absorbed landowner peasant enough capital invest farm enough incentive increase productivity land addition small size peasant farm inhibited centralized efficient cultivation land larger field region europe primogeniture le widely practiced peasant land subdivided re-subdivided generation heir brenner writes consequently this naturally reduced general level peasant income surplus available potential investment agriculture slim hope agricultural innovation result account social economic system size europe population limited existing agricultural system technology could support population beyond certain size when population europe surpassed threshold existing economic structure permitted population loss social instability famine could result only modifying existing social structure land ownership distribution could europe population surpass early century level the paragraph synopsis brenner argument the article full text original argument also wrote book article regardless cause population continued fall century remained low plague returned cycle course fourteenth fifteenth century although subsequent plague child plague le virulent great
