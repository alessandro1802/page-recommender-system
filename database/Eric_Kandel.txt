united state settling brooklyn kandel tutored grandfather judaic study accepted yeshiva flatbush graduated attended brooklyn erasmus hall high school new york city school system kandel undergraduate major harvard history literature wrote undergraduate honor thesis the attitude toward national socialism three german writer carl zuckmayer han carossa ernst jünger while harvard place psychology dominated work skinner kandel became interested learning memory however skinner championed strict separation psychology level discourse biological consideration neurology kandel work essentially centered explanation relationship psychology neurology the world neuroscience opened kandel met anna kris whose parent ernst kris marianne rie psychoanalyst sigmund freud pioneer revealing importance unconscious neural process root kandel interest biology motivation unconscious conscious memory citation needed started new york university medical school graduation firmly interested biological basis mind during time met future wife denise bystryn kandel first exposed research harry grundfest laboratory columbia university grundfest known using oscilloscope demonstrate action potential conduction velocity depends axon diameter the researcher kandel interacted contemplating technical challenge intracellular recording electrical activity relatively small neuron vertebrate brain after starting neurobiological work difficult thicket electrophysiology cerebral cortex kandel impressed progress made stephen kuffler using much experimentally accessible system neuron isolated marine invertebrate after becoming aware kuffler work kandel graduated medical school learned stanley crain make microelectrodes could used intracellular recording crayfish giant axon karl lashley well-known american neuropsychologist tried failed identify anatomical locus memory storage cortex brain when kandel joined laboratory neurophysiology national institute health william beecher scoville brenda milner recently described patient lost ability form new memory removal hippocampus kandel took task performing electrophysiological recording hippocampal pyramidal neuron working alden spencer found electrophysiological evidence action potential dendritic tree hippocampal neuron the team also noticed spontaneous pacemaker-like activity neuron well robust recurrent inhibition hippocampus they provided first intracellular record electrical activity underlies epileptic spike intracellular paroxysmal depolarizing shift epileptic run spike intracellular sustained depolarization but respect memory nothing general electrophysiological property hippocampal neuron suggested hippocampus special explicit memory storage kandel began realize memory storage must rely modification synaptic connection neuron complex connectivity hippocampus provide best system study detailed function synapsis kandel aware comparative study behavior konrad lorenz niko tinbergen karl von frisch revealed simple form learning found even simple animal kandel felt would productive select simple animal model would facilitate electrophysiological analysis synaptic change involved learning memory storage believed ultimately result would found applicable human this decision without risk many senior biologist psychologist believed nothing useful could learned human memory studying invertebrate physiology citation needed completing residency psychiatry kandel went paris learn marine mollusk aplysia californica ladislav tauc kandel realized simple form learning habituation sensitization classical conditioning operant conditioning could readily studied ganglion isolated aplysia while recording behavior single cell ganglion one nerve axon pathway ganglion could stimulated weakly electrically conditioned tactile stimulus another pathway stimulated unconditioned pain stimulus following exact protocol used classical conditioning natural stimulus intact animal citation needed electrophysiological change resulting combined stimulus could traced specific synapsis kandel published initial result including form presynaptic potentiation seemed correspond simple form learning kandel took position department physiology psychiatry new york university medical school eventually forming division neurobiology behavior working irving kupferman harold pinsker developed protocol demonstrating simple form learning intact aplysia particular researcher showed famous gill-withdrawal reflex slug protects tender gill tissue danger sensitive habituation sensitization tom carew joined research group helped extend work study restricted short-term memory experiment included physiological process required long-term memory laboratory member including terry walter tom abrams robert hawkins able extend aplysia system study classical conditioning finding helped close apparent gap simple form learning often associated invertebrate complex type learning often recognized vertebrate along fundamental behavioral study work lab traced neuronal circuit sensory neuron interneurons motor neuron involved learned behavior this allowed analysis specific synaptic connection modified learning intact animal the result kandel laboratory provided solid evidence mechanistic basis learning change functional effectiveness previously existing excitatory connection citation needed kandel winning nobel prize physiology medicine result work aplysia biological mechanism memory storage starting james schwartz collaborated kandel biochemical analysis change neuron associated learning memory storage time known long-term memory unlike short-term memory involved synthesis new protein evidence second messenger molecule cyclic amp camp produced aplysia ganglion condition cause short-term memory formation sensitization kandel moved lab columbia university became founding director center neurobiology behavior soon found neurotransmitter serotonin acting produce second messenger camp involved molecular basis sensitization gill-withdrawal reflex collaboration paul greengard resulted demonstration camp-dependent protein kinase also known protein kinase pka acted biochemical pathway response elevated level camp steven siegelbaum identified potassium channel could regulated pka coupling serotonin effect altered synaptic electrophysiology kandel helped form howard hughes medical research institute columbia devoted molecular neural science the kandel lab sought identify protein synthesized convert short-term memory long-lasting memory one nuclear target pka transcriptional control protein creb camp response element binding protein collaboration david glanzman craig bailey kandel identified creb protein involved long-term memory storage one result creb activation increase number synaptic connection thus short-term memory linked functional change existing synapsis long-term memory associated change number synaptic connection some synaptic change observed kandel laboratory provide example hebbian theory one article describes role hebbian learning aplysia siphon-withdrawal reflex the kandel lab also performed important experiment using transgenic mouse system investigating molecular basis memory storage vertebrate hippocampus kandel original idea learning mechanism would conserved animal confirmed neurotransmitter second messenger system protein kinase ion channel transcription factor like creb confirmed function vertebrate invertebrate learning memory storage since kandel actively contributes science member division neurobiology behavior department psychiatry columbia university daniela pollak discovered conditioning mouse associate specific noise protection harm behavior called learned safety produce behavioral antidepressant effect comparable medication this finding reported neuron may inform study cellular interaction antidepressant behavioral treatment kandel also well known textbook helped write principle neural science first published fifth edition book often used teaching reference text medical school undergraduate graduate program kandel member national academy science since also columbia university since life new york city when kandel nobel prize said vienna austrian nobel something found typically viennese opportunistic disingenuous somewhat hypocritical also said certainly austrian nobel jewish-american nobel after got call austrian president thomas klestil asking how make thing right kandel said first doktor-karl-lueger-ring renamed karl lueger anti-semitic mayor vienna cited hitler mein kampf the street ultimately renamed second wanted jewish intellectual community brought back vienna scholarship jewish student researcher also proposed symposium response austria nazism kandel since accepted honorary citizenship vienna participates academic cultural life native city similar carl djerassi kandel book the age insight—as expressed subtitle the quest understand unconscious art mind brain vienna present —represents wide-ranging historical attempt place vienna root cultural modernism
