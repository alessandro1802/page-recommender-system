CA $129  AUD $149  GBP £99  EU €99 The HomePod Mini (stylized as HomePod mini) is a smart speaker developed by Apple Inc. The HomePod Mini was released on November 16, 2020. Roughly a 10 cm (4-inch) sphere, it was released as a smaller and less expensive version of Apple's now-discontinued HomePod. The HomePod Mini is based on the Apple S5 system in a package also used for the Apple Watch Series 5 and SE. It improves Continuity and Handoff integration, enables Siri to recognize up to six people's voices and personalizing responses to each one, and adds the Intercom feature — also available on iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches — enabling users with more than one HomePod to communicate with each other in different rooms.[3] HomePod Mini's wireless capabilities include 802.11n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5, and an ultra-wideband chip for device proximity and AirPlay Handoff. It supports the Thread network protocol, supported by the Connected Home over IP working group.[1] It has a non-detachable USB-C cable and comes with a 20W power adapter. It is designed to operate at temperatures from 32° to 95 °F (0° to 35 °C); at relative humidity between 5% to 90% (noncondensing); and at altitudes up to 10,000 feet (3000 m). It has a temperature and humidity sensor that was unannounced by Apple.[4] It is compatible with devices running iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 and later. tvOS 15 allows the Apple TV to use HomePod Mini as a speaker, supporting a stereo pair.[5] On October 18, 2021, Apple announced that the existing gray and white options would be joined by blue, orange, and yellow versions. The new colors have a tinted touch display that is a lighter hue of the body color, and the braided cable is also colored accordingly. HomePod Mini sold an estimated 2.18 million units in Q1 2021, representing 91% of Apple's smart speaker sales, along with the original HomePod.[9] It sold an estimated 2.5 million units worldwide in Q2 2021, and 4 million units in Q3.[10][11]
