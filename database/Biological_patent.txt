biological patent patent invention field biology law allows patent holder exclude others making using selling importing protected invention limited period time the scope reach biological patent vary among jurisdiction may include biological technology product genetically modified organism genetic material the applicability patent substance process wholly partially natural origin subject debate february judge justice john nicholas ruled federal court australia favour myriad genetics patent gene this landmark ruling affirming validity patent naturally occurring dna sequence however u.s. supreme court came opposite conclusion month later the australian ruling appealed full bench federal court submission case include consideration u.s. supreme court ruling this decision decided affirming nicholas decision favor myriad confirming isolated genetic material gene valid subject patent october high court australia ruled naturally occurring gene patented per canada patent act patent granted canadian intellectual property office cipo patent granted new useful art process machine manufacture composition matter improvement thereon patent granted mere scientific principle abstract theorem. case pharmaceutical along obtaining patent applicant must also seek approval health canada this process governed patented medicine notice compliance regulation harvard college canada commissioner patent also referred oncomouse case supreme court canada ruled higher life form patentable subject matter the oncomouse one first transgenic mouse developed use cancer research first mammal subject patent application writing majority bastarache asserted role parliament address whether higher life form patentable contrast united state patent trademark office issued patent covering method providing cell culture transgenic non-human anima harvard college the patent also allowed europe eventually revoked failure pay fee file translation although animal patented canada allows patent antibody obtained immunizing animal method medical treatment patented canada however medical use claim use antibody treatment particular disease patentable further antigen previously characterized also patentable gene patent confer property right patent holder while cipo grant patent isolated gdna cdna supreme court canada yet ruled gene patentability however child hospital eastern ontario cheo sought invalidate five canadian patent held transgenomic the gene patent covered gene associated genetic testing long syndrome the party reached settlement the patent invalidated transgenomic provided canadian health institution right test canadian disease non-profit basis association molecular pathology myriad united state supreme court determined gene unpatentable product nature intellectual property existed nothing invented given decision majority canadian long syndrome test previously outsourced united state after settlement domestic testing level increased canada the term settlement could set precedent repatriation genetic testing european union directive biotech directive reconciled legislation biological patent among certain country jurisdiction european patent organisation allows patenting natural biological product including gene sequence long isolated natural environment produced mean technical process the european patent office ruled european patent granted process involve destruction human embryo case oncomouse european patent office epo allowed patent the epo patent standard prohibits patent invention contrary ordre public morality patent also could issued animal variety essentially biological process production ofâ€¦animals the epo undertook utilitarian balancing test make determination ordre public morality exception they found likelihood advancing cancer research medical benefit outweighed potential suffering animal the epo also determined oncomouse animal variety thus excluded amended patent claim limited mouse issued under umbrella biotechnology application patent biological invention examined according general guideline patent response request additional clarity japan patent office jpo set forth specific guideline biology-related invention over year jpo continued amend guideline clarify application new technology these amendment broadened scope patent within biotechnology industry the japanese patent act requires patented invention industrially applicable i.e must market commercial potential the jpo explicitly list medical activity among invention fall outside scope industrially applicable invention meaning method surgery therapy diagnosis human disease patented united state natural biological substance could patented apart associated process usage sufficiently isolated naturally occurring state prominent historical example patent include adrenaline insulin vitamin various gene landmark ruling u.s. supreme court june declared naturally occurring dna sequence ineligible patent gene patent form intellectual property provide patent holder exclusive right exclude others making using selling importing invention specified period time typically twenty year the patenting gene controversial issue term bioethics some believe unethical patent genetic material treat life commodity undermines dignity people animal allowing ownership gene some say living material occur naturally therefore patented along concern commodification human life medical community also warned gene patent inhibit practice medicine progress science for example american medical association stance gene patent inhibit access genetic testing patient hinder research genetic disease contrary position forbidding patent biotechnological innovation would also unethical supporter idea suggest patent allow public well policy maker hold owner patent accountable they favour biological patent require disclosure information public agreement agreement trade-related aspect intellectual property right trip require member world trade organization wto intellectual property protection law place biological innovation the cost research development innovation biologics extremely high such protection regime help protect innovator free-riders based provision unlikely many country prohibit patent gene altogether another area controversy genetic patenting gene sample obtained prior consent required collect genetic sample collection sample people requires consent national community level well individual level conflict resulted consent obtained three level the question benefit sharing also arises obtaining genetic sample specifically potential responsibility collector share benefit profit discovery population person sample came the last major ethical issue involving gene patent patent used post-issuance the use patented material process expensive even prohibited degree condition patent owner set limiting access like would directly impact agricultural institute university researcher among others there potential holder biotechnology patent exploit right order make larger profit potential expense farmer healthcare patient user patented technology the ethic using patent increase profit also debated typical argument favour biotech patent enable company earn money company turn invest research without patent worry company would longer resource motif perform competitive viable biotech research light pandemic several company around world raced develop testing vaccine cure this required substantial investment time money patent used protect innovation patent holder able refuse licensing third-parties manufacture patented medicine creating monopoly patent holder lower supply level furthermore patent-holders control pricing licensing access this patent-regime potential limit access life-saving vaccine cure especially poor country pharmaceutical industry executive diminished idea sharing intellectual property arguing company would incentive innovate patent considered worthless pandemic however health advocate argue taxpayer substantially contributed development vaccine thus regarded global public good lack access medication vaccine especially problematic global pandemic april director general world health organization supported proposal carlos alvarado create pool right testing medicine vaccine free access affordable licensing term country asked company country research institution support open data open science open collaboration. warned poorer country would hardest hit pandemic failure assist could prolong pandemic instead patent-holders undertaken case-by-case negotiation form exclusive licensing contract this approach criticized global health community slow especially variant concerned further poor country south africa paid per dose vaccine rich country european union one potential remedy state implement compulsory patent license these license give state power grant permission third party formulate generic version medicine use state this beneficial state lesser buying power however initiative popular industry march israel became first country issue related compulsory license section patent statute this provision allowed israel undermine patent regime national defence purpose consultation patent-holder required right judicial review the permit allowed israel import generic version kaletra india treat covid patient canada bill came force march allows commissioner patent allow country produce sell use patented invention federal minister health deems public health emergency although consultation patent-holders required country compensate amount commissioner considers adequate remuneration circumstances. germany also allowed federal health minister take executive action make medicine available return adequate compensation france amended patent law preclude need amicable negotiation patent-holders urgency exists these issue may also addressed use voluntary licensing proposal alternatively public pressure patent holder may play significant role for example labrador diagnostics llc purchased patent defunct theranos brought action sought injunction biofire diagnostics making diagnostic test the action abandoned public backlash
