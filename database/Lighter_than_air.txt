gas nitrogen gas non-flammable much cheaper helium the concept using steam lifting therefore already year old the biggest challenge always make material resist university team berlin germany successfully made steam lifted balloon however design generally impractical due high boiling point condensation hydrogen fluoride lighter air could theoretically used lifting gas however extremely corrosive highly toxic expensive heavier lifting gas high boiling point it use would therefore impractical acetylene lighter air could used lifting gas it extreme flammability low lifting power make unattractive choice hydrogen cyanide lighter air technically capable used lifting gas temperature boiling point it extreme toxicity low buoyancy high boiling point precluded use neon lighter air density g/l stp average atomic mass g/mol could lift balloon like helium non-flammable however rare earth expensive among heavier lifting gas pure nitrogen advantage inert abundantly available major component air however nitrogen lighter air obvious choice lifting gas ethylene unsaturated hydrocarbon le dense air unlike nitrogen however ethylene highly flammable far expensive rendering use lifting gas highly impractical diborane slightly lighter molecular nitrogen molecular mass being pyrophoric however major safety hazard scale even greater hydrogen theoretically aerostatic vehicle could made use vacuum partial vacuum early century first manned hot-air balloon flight italian monk francesco lana terzi envisioned ship four vacuum sphere theoretically perfect situation weightless sphere 'vacuum balloon would net lifting force hydrogen-filled balloon net lifting force helium-filled one however wall balloon must able remain rigid without imploding balloon impractical construct known material despite sometimes discussion topic hydrogen helium commonly used lift gas although helium twice heavy diatomic hydrogen significantly lighter air making difference negligible the lifting power air hydrogen helium calculated using theory buoyancy follows thus helium almost twice dense hydrogen however buoyancy depends upon difference density ρgas ρair rather upon ratio thus difference buoyancy seen buoyancy equation where buoyant force newton gravitational acceleration n/kg volume therefore amount mass lifted hydrogen air sea level equal density difference hydrogen air buoyant force one hydrogen air sea level therefore amount mass lifted helium air sea level buoyant force one helium air sea level thus hydrogen additional buoyancy compared helium this calculation sea level for higher altitude higher temperature amount lift decrease proportionally air density ratio lifting capability hydrogen helium remain this calculation include mass envelope need hold lifting gas higher altitude air pressure lower therefore pressure inside balloon also lower this mean mass lifting gas mass displaced air given lift lower altitude volume balloon much greater higher altitude balloon designed lift extreme height stratosphere must able expand enormously order displace required amount air that balloon seem almost empty launch seen photo different approach high altitude ballooning especially used long duration flight superpressure balloon superpressure balloon maintains higher pressure inside balloon external ambient pressure because enormous density difference water
