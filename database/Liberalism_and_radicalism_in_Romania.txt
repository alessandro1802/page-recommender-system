This article gives an overview of liberalism and radicalism in Romania. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ denotes another party in this scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it is not necessary for a party to have actually labeled itself as a liberal party. Liberalism has been one of the major political forces in Romania since the Wallachian Revolution of 1848, which was later mainly organized in the centre-right historical National Liberal Party (PNL), especially at governmental level.  As of July 2022, the contemporary National Liberal Party (PNL) is the head of the Romanian government with its incumbent Prime Minister, Nicolae Ciucă, with elected members in both houses of the Romanian Parliament (more specifically 80 in the Chamber of Deputies and 37 in the Senate) as well as in the European Parliament (where it is the largest Romanian party, having 10 MEPs out of 33 allocated for Romania). At European Parliament level, the PNL is a member party of European People's Party (EPP) and thereby part of the European People's Party Group (EPP Group). The National Liberal Party (PNL) has historically had many spin-offs (or breakaway factions) and mergers alike with other centre-right parties (many of which were former breakaway factions returning to the main party). For example, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats (ALDE) was such a notable relatively recent spin-off/breakaway faction. Furthermore, the Romanian ALDE was a junior partner in a coalition government along the Social Democratic Party (PSD) between 2017 and 2019, before merging again in the PNL in early 2022.
