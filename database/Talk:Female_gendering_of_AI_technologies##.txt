A lot of unsourced “information” (Personal opinions), it’s written in a erratic way, the article looks like a Facebook page random post. It’s absolutely biased, with clearly political agenda being supported entirely. The article should be rewritten completely, the matter is very important, and the article should reflect that. With sourced information, unbiased, and even if biased, it should show all sides of the political spectrum, and not only radical left segment of the Democratic Party (Which is, apparently, the only one represented here). Sorry about possible misspellings from this non native English speaker that talks to you.— Preceding unsigned comment added by 179.83.29.72 (talk • contribs) 10 June 2020 (UTC) I agree with Munfarid. "Unbiased" should not be taken to mean "present all sides as if they are equal propositions." Arguments made in bad faith, for example, should not be held in equal weight as an argument with a long history of scientific consensus.

Obviously, there have not been any such arguments on this talk page since June 2020. Munfarid1 (talk) 17:17, 6 July 2021 (UTC)Reply[reply]
