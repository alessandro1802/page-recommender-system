mathematics variable latin variabilis changeable symbol placeholder mathematical object particular variable may represent number vector matrix function argument function set element set algebraic computation variable explicit number solve range problem single computation for example quadratic formula solves quadratic equation substituting numeric value coefficient equation variable represent quadratic formula mathematical logic variable either symbol representing unspecified term theory meta-variable basic object theory manipulated without referring possible intuitive interpretation ancient work euclid element single letter refer geometric point shape century brahmagupta used different colour represent unknown algebraic equation brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta one section book called equation several colour end century françois viète introduced idea representing known unknown number letter nowadays called variable idea computing numbers—in order obtain result simple replacement viète convention use consonant known value vowel unknown rené descartes invented convention representing unknown equation knowns contrarily viète convention descartes still commonly use the history letter math discussed scientific american article starting isaac newton gottfried wilhelm leibniz independently developed infinitesimal calculus essentially consists studying infinitesimal variation variable quantity induces corresponding variation another quantity function first variable almost century later leonhard euler fixed terminology infinitesimal calculus introduced notation function variable value until end century word variable referred almost exclusively argument value function second half century appeared foundation infinitesimal calculus formalized enough deal apparent paradox nowhere differentiable continuous function solve problem karl weierstrass introduced new formalism consisting replacing intuitive notion limit formal definition the older notion limit variable varies tends toward tends toward without accurate definition tends weierstrass replaced sentence formula none five variable considered varying this static formulation led modern notion variable simply symbol representing mathematical object either unknown may replaced element given set e.g. set real number variable generally denoted single letter often latin alphabet le often greek may lowercase capitalized the letter may followed subscript number another variable word abbreviation word xtotal mathematical expression under influence computer science variable name pure mathematics consist several letter digit following rené descartes letter beginning alphabet commonly used known value parameter letter end alphabet commonly used unknown variable function printed mathematics norm set variable constant italic typeface for example general quadratic function conventionally written \textstyle ax^ +bx+c\ parameter also called constant constant function variable function explicit way denote function \textstyle x\mapsto ax^ +bx+c\ clarifies function-argument status constant status since occurs term constant function called constant term specific branch application mathematics specific naming convention variable variable similar role meaning often assigned consecutive letter letter different subscript for example three ax coordinate space conventionally called physic name variable largely determined physical quantity describe various naming convention exist convention often followed probability statistic use name random variable keeping variable representing corresponding better-defined value common variable play different role mathematical formula name qualifier introduced distinguish for example general cubic equation interpreted five variable four taken given number fifth variable understood unknown number distinguish variable called unknown variable called parameter coefficient sometimes constant although last terminology incorrect equation reserved function defined left-hand side equation context function term variable refers commonly argument function this typically case sentence like function real variable variable function function variable meaning argument function referred variable context variable independent define constant function therefore called constant for example constant integration arbitrary constant function added particular antiderivative obtain antiderivatives because strong relationship polynomial polynomial function term constant often used denote coefficient polynomial constant function indeterminates this use constant abbreviation constant function must distinguished normal meaning word mathematics constant mathematical constant well unambiguously defined number mathematical object example number identity element group since variable may represent mathematical object letter represents constant often called variable this particular case even represents euler number ... other specific name variable all denomination variable semantic nature way computing syntax calculus application physic science rather common consider variable say whose possible value depend value another variable say mathematical term dependent variable represents value function simplify formula often useful use symbol dependent variable function mapping onto for example state physical system depends measurable quantity pressure temperature spatial position ... quantity vary system evolves function time formula describing system quantity represented variable dependent time thus considered implicitly function time therefore formula dependent variable variable implicitly function another several variable independent variable variable dependent the property variable dependent independent depends often point view intrinsic for example notation three variable may independent notation represents function three variable hand depend dependent variable notation represents function single independent variable one defines function real number real number variable standing argument function defined real number identity variable summation variable designates turn integer ... also called index variation discrete set value parameter vary within formula theory polynomial polynomial degree generally denoted called coefficient assumed fixed i.e. parameter problem considered called variable when studying polynomial polynomial function stand function argument when studying polynomial object taken indeterminate would often written capital letter instead indicate status consider equation describing ideal gas law one could rearrange equation obtain \displaystyle function variable however experiment order determine dependence pressure single one independent variable necessary fix one variable say \displaystyle this give function this illustrates independent variable constant largely dependent point view taken one could even regard \displaystyle variable obtain function considering constant variable lead concept modulus space for illustration consider equation parabola then instead regarding \displaystyle \displaystyle variable observe set \displaystyle corresponds different parabola that specify coordinate 'space parabola known modulus space parabola
