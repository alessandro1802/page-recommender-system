logic disjunction logical connective typically notated \displaystyle \lor read aloud for instance english language sentence raining snowing represented logic using disjunctive formula \displaystyle r\lor assuming \displaystyle abbreviates raining \displaystyle abbreviates snowing classical logic disjunction given truth functional semantics according formula \displaystyle \phi \lor \psi true unless \displaystyle \phi \displaystyle \psi false because semantics allows disjunctive formula true disjuncts true inclusive interpretation disjunction contrast exclusive disjunction classical proof theoretical treatment often given term rule disjunction introduction disjunction elimination disjunction also given numerous non-classical treatment motivated problem including aristotle sea battle argument heisenberg uncertainty principle well numerous mismatch classical disjunction nearest equivalent natural language because logical mean formula either true referred inclusive disjunction this contrast exclusive disjunction true one argument true referred exclusive xor when necessary clarify whether inclusive exclusive intended english speaker sometimes us phrase and/or term logic phrase identical make inclusion true explicit logic related field disjunction customarily notated infix operator \displaystyle \lor alternative notation include \displaystyle used mainly electronics well \displaystyle \vert \displaystyle \vert \vert many programming language the english word sometimes used well often capital letter jan łukasiewicz prefix notation logic operator short polish alternatywa english alternative semantics logic classical disjunction truth functional operation return truth value true unless argument false it semantic entry standardly given follows this semantics corresponds following truth table classical logic system logical disjunction primitive defined term primitive \displaystyle \land \displaystyle \lnot alternatively may defined term implies \displaystyle \to the latter checked following truth table the following property apply disjunction operator corresponding logical disjunction exist programming language disjunction often used bitwise operation example the operator used set bit bit field or-ing field constant field relevant bit set for example force final bit leaving bit unchanged citation needed many language distinguish bitwise logical disjunction providing two distinct operator language following bitwise disjunction performed single pipe operator logical disjunction double pipe operator logical disjunction usually short-circuited first left operand evaluates true second right operand evaluated the logical disjunction operator thus usually constitutes sequence point parallel concurrent language possible short-circuit side evaluated parallel one terminates value true interrupted this operator thus called parallel although type logical disjunction expression boolean language thus value true false language python javascript logical disjunction operator return one operand first operand evaluates true value second operand otherwise citation needed the curry–howard correspondence relates constructivist form disjunction tagged union type citation needed the membership element union set set theory defined term logical disjunction \displaystyle x\in a\cup b\leftrightarrow x\in \vee x\in because logical disjunction satisfies many identity set-theoretic union associativity commutativity distributivity morgan law identifying logical conjunction set intersection logical negation set complement citation needed disjunction natural language precisely match interpretation \displaystyle \lor classical logic notably classical disjunction inclusive natural language disjunction often understood exclusively following english typically would this inference sometimes understood entailment instance alfred tarski suggested natural language disjunction ambiguous classical nonclassical interpretation more recent work pragmatic shown inference derived conversational implicature basis semantic denotation behaves classically however disjunctive construction including hungarian vagy ...

interpretation disjunction many language disjunctive expression play role question formation for instance following english example interpreted polar question asking whether true mary either philosopher linguist also interpreted alternative question asking two profession the role disjunction case analyzed using nonclassical logic alternative semantics inquisitive semantics also adopted
