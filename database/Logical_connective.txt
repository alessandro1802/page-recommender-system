logic logical connective also called logical operator sentential connective sentential operator logical constant they used connect logical formula for instance syntax propositional logic binary connective \displaystyle \lor used join two atomic formula \displaystyle \displaystyle rendering complex formula \displaystyle p\lor common connective include negation disjunction conjunction implication standard system classical logic connective interpreted truth function though receive variety alternative interpretation nonclassical logic their classical interpretation similar meaning natural language expression english identical discrepancy natural language connective classical logic motivated nonclassical approach natural language meaning well approach pair classical compositional semantics robust pragmatic logical connective similar equivalent syntax commonly used programming language called conditional operator better source needed formal language truth function represented unambiguous symbol this allows logical statement understood ambiguous way these symbol called logical connective logical operator propositional operator classical logic truth-functional connective for rule allow new well-formed formula constructed joining well-formed formula using truth-functional connective see well-formed formula logical connective used link zero statement one speak n-ary logical connective the boolean constant true false thought zero-ary operator negation connective commonly used logical connective include alternative name biconditional iff xnor bi-implication for example meaning statement raining denoted indoors denoted transformed two combined logical connective also common consider always true formula always false formula connective some

calculus notably classical logic certain essentially different compound statement logically equivalent le trivial example redundancy classical equivalence therefore classical-based logical system need conditional operator already use may use syntactic sugar compound one negation one disjunction there sixteen boolean function associating input truth value four-digit binary output these correspond possible choice binary logical connective classical logic different implementation classical logic choose different functionally complete subset connective one approach choose minimal set define connective logical form example material conditional the following minimal functionally complete set operator classical logic whose arity exceed another approach use equal right connective certain convenient functionally complete minimal set this approach requires propositional axiom equivalence logical form must either axiom provable theorem the situation however complicated intuitionistic
