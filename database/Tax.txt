introduction cause two consequence the income effect show variation good quantity given change real income the substitution effect show variation good determined relative price variation this kind taxation cause substitution effect considered distortionary another example introduction income lump-sum tax xpx ypy parallel shift downward budget constraint produced higher revenue loss consumer utility compared property tax case another point view revenue produced lower utility sacrifice the lower utility revenue lower revenue utility given distortionary tax called excess pressure the result reached income lump-sum tax obtained following type tax cause budget constraint shift without causing substitution effect budget constraint slope remains -px/py when rate chosen respecting equation rate income tax tau consumption tax rate \displaystyle \frac \frac \tau effect two tax tax effectively change relative price product therefore economist especially neoclassical economist argue taxation creates market distortion result economic inefficiency unless positive negative externality associated activity taxed need internalized reach efficient market outcome they therefore sought

thereby contributing shortage skilled worker unusually high difference pre-tax earnings highly educated less-educated worker tax even effect labor supply consider model consumer chooses number hour

individual renounces consuming additional hour free time consumption hour work positive relationship hour work mean earnings assuming worker n't save money earnings imply increase consumption free time consumption considered two normal good worker decide working one hour would mean consuming one hour free time budget constraint negatively inclined the indifference curve related two good negative slope free time becomes important high level consumption this high level consumption mean people already spending many hour working situation need free time consume implies paid higher salary work additional hour proportional income tax changing budget constraint slope implies substitution income effect the problem two effect opposite way income effect tell income tax consumer feel poorer
