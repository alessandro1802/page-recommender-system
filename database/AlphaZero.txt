alphazero computer program developed artificial intelligence research company deepmind master game chess shogi this algorithm us approach similar alphago zero december deepmind team released preprint introducing alphazero within hour training achieved superhuman level play three game defeating world-champion program stockfish elmo three-day version alphago zero case made use custom tensor processing unit tpus google program optimized use alphazero trained solely via self-play using first-generation tpus generate game second-generation tpus train neural network parallel access opening book endgame table after four hour training deepmind estimated alphazero playing chess higher elo rating stockfish nine hour training algorithm defeated stockfish time-controlled tournament win loss draw the trained algorithm played single machine four tpus deepmind paper alphazero published journal science december however alphazero program made available public deepmind published new paper detailing muzero new algorithm able generalise alphazero work playing atari board game without knowledge rule representation game alphazero generalized variant alphago zero agz algorithm able play shogi chess well difference agz include comparing monte carlo tree search search alphazero search position per second chess shogi compared million stockfish million elmo alphazero compensates lower number evaluation using deep neural network focus much selectively promising variation alphazero trained solely via self-play using first-generation tpus generate game second-generation tpus train neural network parallel in-training alphazero periodically matched benchmark stockfish elmo alphago zero brief one-second-per-move game determine well training progressing deepmind judged alphazero performance exceeded benchmark around four hour training stockfish two hour elmo eight hour alphago zero alphazero chess match stockfish tcec world champion program given one minute per move stockfish allocated thread hash size setting stockfish tord romstad later criticized suboptimal note alphazero trained chess total nine hour match during match alphazero ran single machine four application-specific tpus game normal starting position alphazero game white black drew remaining series twelve match unspecified time resource constraint stockfish starting popular human opening alphazero drew lost alphazero trained shogi total two hour tournament shogi game elmo world computer shogi championship summer tournament version yaneuraou search alphazero time lost time drew twice chess game program got one minute per move elmo given thread hash size after hour self-learning alphago zero alphazero game lost deepmind stated preprint the game chess represented pinnacle research several decade state-of-the-art program based powerful engine search many million position leveraging handcrafted domain expertise sophisticated domain adaptation alphazero generic reinforcement learning algorithm originally devised game achieved superior result within hour searching thousand time fewer position given domain knowledge except rule deepmind demis hassabis chess player called alphazero play style alien sometimes win offering counterintuitive sacrifice like offering queen bishop exploit positional advantage like chess another dimension given difficulty chess forcing win strong opponent result significant margin victory however grandmaster hikaru nakamura komodo developer larry kaufman downplayed alphazero victory arguing match would closer program access opening database since stockfish optimized scenario romstad additionally pointed stockfish optimized rigidly fixed-time move version used year old similarly shogi observer argued elmo hash size low resignation setting enteringkingrule setting shogi entering king may inappropriate elmo already obsolete compared newer program paper headlined chess training took four hour managed little time breakfast lunch wired described alphazero first multi-skilled board-game champ expert joanna bryson noted google knack good publicity putting strong position challenger hiring best programmer also political help make google strong possible negotiating government regulator looking sector human chess grandmaster generally expressed excitement alphazero danish grandmaster peter heine nielsen likened alphazero play superior alien specie norwegian grandmaster jon ludvig hammer characterized alphazero play insane attacking chess profound positional understanding former champion garry kasparov said remarkable achievement even expected alphago grandmaster hikaru nakamura le impressed stated n't necessarily put lot credibility result simply understanding alphazero basically using google supercomputer stockfish n't run hardware stockfish basically running would laptop wan match comparable stockfish running supercomputer well top correspondence chess player wolff morrow also unimpressed claiming alphazero would probably make semifinal fair competition tcec engine play equal hardware morrow stated although might able beat alphazero alphazero played drawish opening petroff defence alphazero would able beat correspondence chess game either motohiro isozaki author yaneuraou noted although alphazero comprehensively beat elmo rating alphazero shogi stopped growing point higher elmo this gap high elmo shogi software able catch year deepmind addressed many criticism final version paper published december science they clarified alphazero running supercomputer trained using tensor processing unit tpus ran four tpus cpu match final result stockfish version ran condition tcec superfinal cpu core syzygy endgame tablebases hash size instead fixed time control one move per minute engine given hour plus second per move finish game match alphazero score win loss draw deepmind also played series game using tcec opening position alphazero also convincingly stockfish needed time odds match alphazero similar stockfish elmo ran condition csa championship the version elmo used combination yaneuraou early kppt tournament elmo operated hardware stockfish cpu core hash size alphazero game playing sente i.e first move overall human grandmaster generally impressed alphazero game stockfish former world champion garry kasparov said pleasure watch alphazero play especially since style open dynamic like computer chess community komodo developer mark lefler called pretty amazing achievement also pointed data old since stockfish gained lot strength since january stockfish released fellow developer larry kaufman said alphazero would probably lose match latest version stockfish stockfish top chess engine championship tcec condition kaufman argued advantage neural network–based engine used gpu regard power consumption e.g equal-hardware contest engine access cpu gpu anything gpu achieved free based stated strongest engine likely hybrid neural network standard alpha–beta search alphazero inspired computer chess community develop leela chess zero using technique alphazero leela contested several championship stockfish showed roughly similar strength stockfish although stockfish since pulled away deepmind published muzero unified system played excellent chess shogi well game atari learning environment without pre-programmed rule the match result particularly meaningful rather strange choice time control stockfish parameter setting the game played fixed time minute/move mean stockfish use time management heuristic lot effort put making stockfish identify critical point game decide spend extra time move fixed time per move strength suffer significantly the version stockfish used one year old playing far search thread ever received significant amount testing way small hash table number thread believe percentage draw would much higher match normal condition
