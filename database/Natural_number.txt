mathematics natural number number used counting six coin table ordering third largest city country number used counting called cardinal number number used ordering called ordinal number natural number sometimes used label known nominal number none property number mathematical sense e.g sport jersey number some definition including standard iso begin natural number corresponding non-negative integer ... whereas others start corresponding positive integer ... text exclude zero natural number sometimes refer natural number together zero whole number writing term used instead integer including negative integer the natural number form set many number set built successively extending set natural number integer including additive identity yet additive inverse nonzero natural number rational number including multiplicative inverse \displaystyle nonzero integer also product inverse integer real number including limit converging cauchy sequence rational complex number adjoining real number square root also sum product thereof this chain extension canonically embeds natural number number system property natural number divisibility distribution prime number studied number theory problem concerning counting ordering partitioning enumeration studied combinatorics common language particularly primary school education natural number may called counting number intuitively exclude negative integer zero also contrast discreteness counting continuity measurement—a hallmark characteristic real number the primitive method representing natural number put mark object later set object could tested equality excess shortage—by striking mark removing object set the first major advance abstraction use numeral represent number this allowed system developed recording large number the ancient egyptian developed powerful system numeral distinct hieroglyph power million stone carving karnak dating back around bce louvre paris depicts hundred ten one similarly number the babylonian place-value system based essentially numeral using base sixty symbol sixty symbol one—its value determined context much later advance development idea considered number numeral the use digit place-value notation within number date back early bce babylonian omitted digit would last symbol number the olmec maya civilization used separate number early century bce usage spread beyond mesoamerica the use numeral modern time originated indian mathematician brahmagupta however used number medieval computus calculation date easter beginning dionysius exiguus without denoted numeral standard roman numeral symbol instead nulla genitive form nullae nullus latin word none employed denote value the first systematic study number abstraction usually credited greek philosopher pythagoras archimedes some greek mathematician treated number differently larger number sometimes even number euclid example defined unit first number multitude unit thus definition unit number unique number e.g. two unit indefinitely many unit independent study number also occurred around time india china mesoamerica century europe mathematical philosophical discussion exact nature natural number school naturalism stated natural number direct consequence human psyche henri poincaré one advocate leopold kronecker summarized belief god made integer else work man opposition naturalist constructivist saw need improve upon logical rigor foundation mathematics hermann grassmann suggested recursive definition natural number thus stating really natural—but consequence definition later two class formal definition constructed later still shown equivalent practical application set-theoretical definition natural number initiated frege initially defined natural number class set one-to-one correspondence particular set however definition turned lead paradox including russell paradox avoid paradox formalism modified natural number defined particular set set put one-to-one

axiomatization property ordinal number natural number successor every non-zero natural number unique predecessor peano arithmetic equiconsistent several weak system set theory one system zfc axiom

among set theorist logician other mathematician also include computer language often start zero enumerating item like loop counter string- array-elements hand many mathematician kept older tradition take first natural number the set natural number standardly denoted \displaystyle \mathbb older text occasionally employed symbol set since natural number may contain may important know version referred this often specified context may also done using subscript superscript notation alternatively since natural number naturally form subset integer often denoted \displaystyle \mathbb may

counting ordering cardinal number ordinal number the least ordinal cardinality initial ordinal many well-ordered set cardinal number ordinal number greater for finite well-ordered set one-to-one correspondence ordinal cardinal number therefore expressed natural number number element set this number also used describe position element larger finite infinite sequence countable non-standard model arithmetic satisfying peano arithmetic first-order peano axiom developed skolem the hypernatural number uncountable model constructed ordinary natural number via ultrapower construction george reeb used claim provocatively the naïve integer n't fill \displaystyle \mathbb other generalization discussed article number there two standard method formally defining natural number the first one due giuseppe peano consists autonomous axiomatic theory called peano arithmetic based axiom called peano axiom the second definition based set theory defines natural number specific set more precisely natural number defined explicitly defined set whose element allow counting element set sense sentence set element mean exists one one correspondence two set the set used define natural number satisfy peano axiom follows every theorem stated proved peano arithmetic also proved set theory however two definition equivalent theorem stated term peano arithmetic proved set theory provable inside peano arithmetic probable example fermat last theorem the definition integer set satisfying peano axiom provide model peano arithmetic inside set theory important consequence set theory consistent usually guessed peano arithmetic consistent word contradiction could proved peano arithmetic set theory would contradictory every theorem set theory would true wrong the five peano axiom following these original axiom published peano named honor some form peano axiom place ordinary arithmetic successor \displaystyle \displaystyle intuitively natural number common property set element seems natural define equivalence class relation made one one correspondence unfortunately work set theory equivalence class would set russell paradox the standard solution define particular set element called natural number the following definition first punlished john von neumann although levy attribute idea unpublished work zermelo definition extends infinite set definition ordinal number set considered sometimes called von neumann ordinal the definition proceeds follows follows natural number defined iteratively follows checked natural number satisfies peano axiom with definition given natural number sentence set element formally defined exists bijection this formalizes operation counting element also subset word set inclusion defines usual total order natural number this order well-order follows definition natural number equal set natural number le this definition extended von neumann definition ordinal defining ordinal number including infinite one ordinal well-ordered set smaller ordinal one accept axiom infinity natural number may form set nevertheless natural number still individually defined still satisfy peano axiom there set theoretical construction particular ernst zermelo provided construction nowadays historical interest sometimes referred zermelo ordinal consists defining empty set with definition natural number singleton set property natural number represent cardinality directly accessible ordinal property nth element sequence immediate unlike von neumann construction zermelo ordinal extend infinite ordinal
