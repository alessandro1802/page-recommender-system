Since February 2011 MTV has been solely an entertainment channel.[1][2] The channel is in over 10 million homes in the UK and Ireland.[3] From its inception, MTV UK (then branded as MTV UK & Ireland) the network served United Kingdom and Ireland.

Part of the rebrand saw a 50/50 balance in the number of music based programming and reality based TV series that air on the channels.[9] From 2010, MTV increased its music output which has since been diluted by reality based television programmes.
