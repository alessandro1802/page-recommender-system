digital cable distribution cable television using digital data video compression the technology first developed general instrument cable company offered digital feature eventually replacing previous analog-based cable mid during late broadcast television converted digital hdtv standard incompatible existing analog cable system addition providing high-definition video digital cable system provide service pay-per-view programming cable internet access cable telephone service most digital cable signal encrypted reduced incidence cable television piracy occurred analog system general instrument acquired motorola owned arris group demonstrated possible use digital compression deliver high quality hdtv standard mhz television channel using technology general instrument demonstrated digital transmission multiple high quality standard definition program mhz cable channel cable provider began invest heavily new multi-channel digital technology expand number channel service available subscriber increased competition programming choice direct-broadcast satellite service directv dish network primestar caused cable provider seek new way provide programming customer increasingly interested channel pay-per-view programming digital music service high speed internet service cable provider offering form digital cable customer digital cable technology allowed cable provider compress video channel take le bandwidth offer two-way communication capability this enabled provider offer channel video-on-demand service n't require separate telephone line telephone service high speed internet service interactive television service digital cable implement error correction ensure integrity received signal us secure digital distribution system i.e secure encrypted signal prevent eavesdropping theft service most digital cable provider use qam video service docsis standard data service some provider also begun roll video service using iptv switched video digital cable technology allow many channel occupy frequency space would normally occupied single analog cable channel the number channel placed single analog frequency depends compression used many cable provider able fit digital channel digital channel single analog channel frequency some provider able squeeze channel onto single frequency higher compression often cause video quality channel degrade the addition capability complicates notion channel digital cable well over-the-air atsc digital broadcast the formal name two number identify channel physical channel subchannel the physical channel number corresponding specific mhz frequency range see north american cable television frequency the subchannel logical channel data within physical channel technically subchannels physical channel though practice used bandwidth must divided among subchannels there two way provider try make easier consumer the first accomplished psip program channel information broadcast along video allowing consumer decoder set-top box display automatically identify many channel subchannels the second also accomplished psip effort hide subchannels entirely many cable company map virtual channel number underlying physical sub-channels for example cable company might call channel channel channel channel this also allows cable company change frequency channel without changing customer see channel number arrangement physical/sub-channel number called qam channel alternative channel designation called mapped channel virtual channel simply channel theory set-top box decode psip information every channel receives use information build mapping qam channel virtual channel however cable company always reliably transmit psip information alternatively cablecards receive channel mapping communicate
