this article only has one contributer: user:Djstasiewski which has gone around promoting the company with spam on numerous pages. seems to have a clear WP:COI. also user:207.54.137.62 the page only cites from the company and its press releasesScientus (talk) 20:08, 14 March 2009 (UTC)Reply[reply] Suggest do not delete.  Original complaints included that there was only one editor (seems inaccurate based upon glance at history, other names appear, therefore no longer a defensible position) as well as that user's character (see aforementioned, no longer a defensible position).  As for citations (quantity or quality), should previous user find a lack, edit tools are available for fixing same.  I also suggest closing any such vote as the original objections have been mostly overcome...--Nouniquenames (talk) 05:27, 24 May 2012 (UTC)Reply[reply] I believe the new Overdrive software performs transcoding so protected content can be transfered and played on the iPod. -- BlindWanderer (talk) 17:17, 26 October 2009 (UTC)Reply[reply] In the lede, the first reference is to the company's web site, and it is marked "Unreliable source" twice, this way.[unreliable source?] Is this the proper way to go?--Dthomsen8 (talk) 19:17, 11 September 2018 (UTC)Reply[reply] You can in fact get Kindle books from OverDrive, at least on the Libby app (which there also seems to be no mention of and no article about). Stellarnebula (talk) 04:34, 3 February 2019 (UTC)Reply[reply] To the recent editors of the OverDrive, Inc. page, My name is Adam Sockel and I'm an employee on the Marketing Team at OverDrive. A number of years ago, a previous employee made changes to our page, while accurate, went against the guidelines of Wikipedia. I'd love to connect with an editor to update our page as it's quite out of date and lacking key aspects of our business. I've created a document with edits that, we believe, fall within the standard Wiki guidelines. We have removed any clear marketing copy and buzzwords and used third party citations for all changes. While I have a Wikipedia account, I know the best practice is to work with an editor as opposed to making the edits myself, being an OverDrive employee. If someone would be willing to connect with me, I'd happily provide the edits we're hoping to make. My direct email is asockel@overdrive.com Cheers, Adam Sockel SocksCLE (talk) 13:02, 20 May 2020 (UTC)Reply[reply] Thanks for the above response! It's much appreciated. We've gone through the page and put edits in and citations for our changes. I have shared all of this below. Please let me know if anything appears unfair or out of line from a requesting standpoint. I had our devs help me with proper formatting.  OverDrive, Inc. is an American digital distributor of eBooks, audiobooks, magazines [1], and video titles. The company provides secure management, digital rights management and download fulfillment services for publishers, libraries, schools, and retailers.[2] OverDrive's catalog includes more than 3 million digital titles[3] from more than 30,000 publishers.[2][unreliable source?] The company's global network includes more than 45,000 public libraries, K-12 schools, colleges and universities, and corporations in 78 countries worldwide.[1] OverDrive created the Libby reading app[4] and Sora student reading app[5], enabling library patrons and students to borrow ebooks and audiobooks. OverDrive was founded in 1986[6] and initially converted analog media to digital formats, such as interactive diskettes and CD-ROMs. As the Internet became a reliable form of digital media distribution, OverDrive moved its services online. In 2000, the company opened Content Reserve, an online ebook and downloadable audiobook repository from which its distribution business would develop[when?].[7] In 2003, OverDrive launched its digital reading platform, first partnering with Cleveland Public Library to offer library card holders access to ebooks. Soon after, Cuyahoga County Public Library began offering the service to their patrons.[8] As of 2020, OverDrive has 22,000 public library system partners globally. In 2007, the U.S. Navy became the first branch of the U.S. military to offer ebook access to their sailors and marines through OverDrive.[9] Since then, all other branches of the U.S. military have also partnered with OverDrive.[10][11][12] In 2008, Virginia Community College System became the first college or university to launch an OverDrive digital library service. K-12 school systems followed shortly.[13] Today, over 20,000 schools have partnered with OverDrive globally.[14] In 2011, OverDrive and Amazon partnered to make borrow of ebooks though OverDrive compatible on Kindle devices for U.S. library users.[15] Also in 2011, OverDrive launched its WIN Catalog, which allows publishers, libraries, and readers to use options such as "Buy It Now", "Recommend to Library", and "Author Impressions".[16][17][unreliable source?] In 2012, the company announced a series of service upgrades, including: OverDrive Read, a browser-based ereader, streaming audiobooks, which enable access to audiobooks via the OverDrive Media Console apps[when?]; Next Generation Content Reserve, a collection-development portal; and OverDrive APIs, which  allow developers to integrate OverDrive content into apps and platforms[when?].[18] The company also announced a partnership with LexisNexis to provide the LexisNexis Digital Library, a customized eLending platform for the legal library market.[19] In 2014, OverDrive completed its Headquarters in the Cleveland suburb of Garfield Heights, Ohio. In 2015, it was reported that Japan's Rakuten was planning to buy out OverDrive for $410 million, with the deal set to close in April 2015. OverDrive CEO Steve Potash will remain in his current position and OverDrive will keep its name while operating under Rakuten USA.[20] In 2016, OverDrive partnered with several award-winning companies, including ABDO Publishing Company, Britannica Digital Learning, Dawn Publications, Lerner Publishing Group, and Open Road Integrated Media to launch a QuickStart ebook collection to promote reading in elementary schools.[21] In June of 2017, OverDrive introduced Libby, a new ebook and audiobook reading app based on feedback from librarians and readers.[4] Libby was named one of TIMEâ€™s Best iPhone and Android Apps of 2018,[22] an Apple Editorsâ€™ Choice App,[23] a Google Play Editors Choice winner.[24] In 2019, PC Magazine named Libby to their Best Free Software of 2019 list[25] and Popular Mechanics named Libby one of The 20 Best Apps of the 2010s.[26] In September of 2018, OverDrive introduced Sora, a reading app similar to Libby but designed for K-12 student readers. Sora enables access to ebooks and audiobooks through the K-12 school or districtâ€™s own digital collection, but also includes capabilities for teachers to assign titles, reading achievements, stats, and the ability to connect to the local public library.[27]  In 2019, TIME Magazine awarded the Sora reading app as a Best Invention of 2019.[28] In 2019, it was  reported that global investment firm KKR would be purchasing OverDrive from Rakuten.[29] The price of the sale was not disclosed, though Rakuten said it would recognize about $365.6 million in profit from the sale in the first quarter of 2020.. OverDrive's purchase from Rakuten was engineered by KKR's Richard Sarnoff, a one-time executive at Random House who also was president of Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments until leaving for KKR in 2011.[30]   KKR also owns RB Digital, an audiobook and ebook distributor.[31] In May of 2020, OverDrive Professional was launched. This new division of the company â€” which brings together teams that currently serve hundreds of colleges, universities, corporations, law firms, law departments and law schools â€” provides access to these organizationsâ€™ own digital content collections through Libby.[32] OverDrive launched its Digital Library Reserve, a digital download platform for public libraries, in 2002.[33]  The eBook distribution service included a download website and access to the Content Reserve collection development portal. In 2004, the platform was changed into a DRM-protected audiobook download platform.[34][unreliable source?]  In 2005, OverDrive installed download stations into public libraries[35] and adding music to its library platform.[36][unreliable source?]  OverDrive added downloadable videos in April 2006.[37][unreliable source?] In 2007, the company launched its School Download Library, an eBook service for Kâ€“12 schools based on Digital Library Reserve. In March 2008, the company announced plans to provide MP3 audiobooks to public libraries as well as retailers.[38] As of May 2020, OverDrive content includes a selection of more than 3 million eBooks, audiobooks, and other digital content available in more than 100+ languages.[3] Before entering the library market, OverDrive distributed eBooks to a number of e-tailers.  In 2002, OverDrive was selected as the distributor of HarperCollinsâ€™ eBooks to the publisher's online retail stores.[39] OverDrive launched web stores for Harlequin Enterprises in 2005.[40]  In 2008, OverDrive announced that it would provide download services for Borders Books.[41] OverDrive has entered into partnerships with technology companies including Adobe Systems, Microsoft, Mobipocket, and Nokia. In 2008, Adobe and OverDrive jointly announced that OverDrive would be the co-developer and operator of Adobe ADEPT, a hosted DRM service to protect files viewed with Adobe Digital Editions.[citation needed] In 2012, OverDrive partnered with Nokia to launch Nokia Reading, an eReading app and service for Nokia's Lumia 900, 800, 710, and 610 Windows Phone devices. [42][unreliable source?] OverDrive's download services include several software as a service products for libraries, retailers, schools, publishers and the military, as well as web-based products for content protection and management. These include: With its Next Generation enhancements, OverDrive also offers:[18] OverDrive holds a biennial user group meeting called Digipalooza to train and educate librarians on the download service. Held in Cleveland, Ohio, the event focuses on trends, best practices, and outreach ideas for public library download websites.[citation needed] At the 2008 Public Library Association National Conference, OverDrive unveiled preliminary plans for the nationally touring Digital Bookmobile.[47]  The traveling exhibit is housed inside an 18-wheeler and visits public libraries throughout the OverDrive network.  Inside the tractor-trailer, learning stations guide patrons through all aspects of their public library's download service.  As of May 2020, OverDrive has hosted more than 1,000 Digital Bookmobile events at libraries, schools and community centers throughout North America.[48] In 2011, OverDrive CEO Steve Potash made obvious hints that the Amazon Kindle would join other major eReaders in public libraries as soon as September 2011. In his "Crystal Ball Report", during the final session of OverDrive's July 2011 Digipalooza conference, he hinted at the month of release.[49] On September 21, 2011, OverDrive began supporting Kindle public library book borrowing.[citation needed] On September 18, 2014, OverDrive debuted International "Read an Ebook" Day, "an annual holiday to celebrate and raise awareness for reading on digital devices".[citation needed] Leading up to and on that day, OverDrive encouraged "readers around the world" to participate "by choosing from millions of free eBooks from their local library or purchasing an eBook from a retailer online".[citation needed] Additionally, throughout the day, OverDrive celebrated "the holiday by giving away tablets and devices every hour on the event website (www.readanebookday.com) and through social media to readers who tell their story of what eBooks mean to them, by using the hashtag #eBookDay on Facebook or Twitter to tell their story, or commenting directly at the event website.[citation needed] OverDrive was criticized in the early 2000s for relying on digital rights management (DRM) protection technology from Microsoft for the bulk of its audiobooks. Microsoft's refusal to update its Macintosh versions of Windows Media Player to accommodate the requisite encryption scheme disqualifies Apple computer users from accessing the bulk of OverDrive's audio files, which are formatted as DRM Windows Media Audio (WMA). In March 2008, OverDrive announced that it would distribute a collection of approximately 3,000 audiobooks in the MP3 format, which is more widely compatible.[50] On November 19, 2008, OverDrive also released the OverDrive Media Console for Mac, which allows Mac owners to download and listen to MP3 audiobooks from their library on a home computer.[citation needed] OverDrive's streaming audiobook optionâ€”scheduled for release in 2012â€”will enable Mac users to access many audiobooks that were previously unavailable due to WMA compatibility issues. [51][unreliable source?] In January 2009, OverDrive informed Fictionwise that it would no longer be providing downloads for purchasers of e-books through Fictionwise as of January 31, 2009; no reason was provided to Fictionwise as to why it was being shut down.  This prevents previous purchasers from being able to renew their books on new devices.[52]  Fictionwise was working to provide replacement ebooks for its customers in alternative, non-DRM-protected formats, but did not have the rights to provide all of the books in different formats.[52]  [[Category:Retail companies of the United States]] [[Category:Software companies based in Ohio]] [[Category:Companies based in Cleveland]] [[Category:Organizations established in 1986]] [[Category:Commercial digital libraries]] [[Category:1986 establishments in Ohio]] [[Category:Library resources]] [[Category:Book selling websites]] [[Category:E-book suppliers]] [[Category:E-book sources]] [[Category:Rakuten]] [[Category:American digital libraries]] [[Category:Mass media companies]] [[Category:Software companies of the United States]] [[Category:Software companies established in 1986]] [[Category:Retail companies established in 1986]] [[Category:Companies established in 1986]] SocksCLE (talk) 18:01, 3 June 2020 (UTC)SocksCLEReply[reply] Hey @DARTHflappy, I appreciate the response! The entire page is wildly out of date so we needed to make major edit requests and thought the quickest way to do so for the Wiki editors would be to write out the content and properly cite them which we did above. It should be fairly turnkey from an approval standpoint. A list of all the changes would be much more time consuming on both ends. Let me know if, at a second look, our content can be approved, or if you have issues with what we've provided. Our goal is to have this page accurately reflect the state of the company which is what we've written above in hopes that an editor could read through and approve. Would love a your thoughts. Thanks so much. SocksCLE (talk) 12:31, 15 June 2020 (UTC)Adam SockelReply[reply]  You may want to read about how wikipedia is not for marketing, or a sales catalogues. Our goal is to summarise what reliable sources say.Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published secondary sources and, to a lesser extent, on tertiary sources and primary sources. Secondary or tertiary sources are needed to establish the topic's notability and to avoid novel interpretations of primary sources. You need to have secondary sources.
