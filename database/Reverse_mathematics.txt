reverse mathematics program mathematical logic seek determine axiom required prove theorem mathematics it defining method briefly described going backwards theorem axiom contrast ordinary mathematical practice deriving theorem axiom conceptualized sculpting necessary condition sufficient one the reverse mathematics program foreshadowed result set theory classical theorem axiom choice zorn lemma equivalent set theory the goal reverse mathematics however study possible axiom ordinary theorem mathematics rather possible axiom set theory reverse mathematics usually carried using subsystem
