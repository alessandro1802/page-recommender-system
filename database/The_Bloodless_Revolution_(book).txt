The Bloodless Revolution: Radical Vegetarianism and the Discovery of India is a 2006 non-fiction book by English author Tristram Stuart. It was published in the United States as The Bloodless Revolution: A Cultural History of Vegetarianism From 1600 to Modern Times.[1] The book documents the history of vegetarianism in Europe over the last 400 years and argues that Western vegetarian diets were influenced by travellers' tales from India.[1][2][3] Stuart explores the vegetarianism of Thomas Bushell, John Robins, Thomas Tryon, George Cheyne, Roger Crab, John Oswald and others.[1][2][4] Historian Chandak Sengoopta commented that "The Bloodless Revolution is a wonderful book, crammed with original research and written with verve, wit and passion. The most enthralling work of cultural history I have read in years, it brings out the political, ethical and environmental implications of our dietary choices without any preachiness."[3] Philosopher A. C. Grayling praised the historical research of the book.[5] The book was positively reviewed by Publishers Weekly who suggested that "Stuart offers a masterful social and cultural history of a movement that changed the ways people think about the food they eat."[6] A review by Kirkus Reviews described it as "Culinary and cultural history intertwined: readable, and endlessly interesting."[7]  This article about a cook book or other food, drink, or cooking-related non-fiction book is a stub.
