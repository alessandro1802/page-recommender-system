https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_with_permanently_dead_external_links
This category keeps track of articles with the {{dead link}} template that have the fix-attempted parameter set to "yes".  These are cases in which someone has tried to fix the dead link by replacing it with an archive link, but no archive could be found. In these cases, it may be best to remove or replace the link.  Please review WP:DEADLINK for current policy before editing the tagged dead links.  The following 200 pages are in this category, out of approximately 174,429 total. This list may not reflect recent changes.
