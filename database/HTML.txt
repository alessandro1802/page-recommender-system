standard facto web standard time html markup consists several key component including called tag attribute character-based data type character reference entity reference html tag commonly come pair like although represent empty element unpaired example img the first tag pair start tag second end tag also called opening tag closing tag another important component html document type declaration trigger standard mode rendering the following example classic hello world program the text html /html describes web page text body /body visible page content the markup text title this title /title defines browser page title shown browser tab window title tag div defines division page used easy styling between head /head meta element used define webpage metadata the document type declaration doctype html declaration included various browser revert quirk mode rendering html document imply structure nested html element these indicated document html tag enclosed angle bracket thus better source needed simple general case extent element indicated pair tag start tag end tag the text content element placed tag tag may also enclose tag markup start end including mixture tag text this indicates nested element child parent element the start tag may also include element attribute within tag these indicate information identifier section within document identifier used bind style information presentation document tag img used embed image reference image resource format like img src= example.com/example.jpg some element line break permit embedded content either text tag these require single empty tag akin start tag use end tag many tag particularly closing end tag commonly used paragraph element optional html browser agent infer closure end element context structural rule defined html standard these rule complex widely understood html coder the general form html element therefore tag content /tag some html element defined empty element take form tag empty element may enclose content instance tag inline img tag the name html element name used tag note end tag name preceded slash character empty element end tag neither required allowed attribute mentioned default value used case header html document head ... /head the title included head example html heading defined tag highest important level least the effect note cs drastically change rendering paragraph line break the difference break line without altering semantic structure page whereas section page paragraph the element empty element although may attribute take content may end tag this link html create link tag used the href attribute hold url address link input there many possible way user give input/s like comment comment help understanding markup display webpage there several type markup element used html most attribute element name–value pair separated written within start tag element element name the value may enclosed single double quote although value consisting certain character left unquoted html xhtml leaving attribute value unquoted considered unsafe contrast name-value pair attribute attribute affect element simply presence start tag element like ismap attribute img element there several common attribute may appear many element the abbreviation element abbr used demonstrate attribute this example display html browser pointing cursor abbreviation display title text hypertext markup language most element take language-related attribute dir specify text direction rtl right-to-left text example arabic persian hebrew version html defines set character entity reference set numeric character reference allow individual character written via simple markup rather literally literal character markup counterpart considered equivalent rendered identically the ability escape character way allows character written amp respectively interpreted character data rather markup for example literal normally indicates start tag normally indicates start character entity reference numeric character reference writing amp allows included content element value attribute the double-quote character used quote attribute value must also escaped quot appears within attribute value equivalently single-quote character used quote attribute value must also escaped apos xhtml document appears within attribute value document author overlook need escape character browser forgiving try use context guess intent the result still invalid markup make document le accessible browser user agent may try parse document search indexing purpose example escaping also allows character easily typed available document character encoding represented within element attribute content for example acute-accented character typically found western european south american keyboard written html document entity reference eacute numeric reference using character available keyboard supported character encoding unicode character encoding compatible modern browser allow direct access almost character world writing system html defines several data type element content script data stylesheet data plethora type attribute value including id name uris number unit length language medium descriptor color character encoding date time all data type specialization character data html document required start document type declaration informally doctype browser doctype help define rendering mode—particularly whether use quirk mode the original purpose doctype enable parsing validation html document sgml tool based document type definition dtd the dtd doctype refers contains machine-readable grammar specifying permitted prohibited content document conforming dtd browser hand implement html application sgml consequence read dtd define dtd therefore doctype declaration simpler shorter example html doctype this declaration reference dtd strict version html sgml-based validators read dtd order properly parse document perform validation modern browser valid doctype activates standard mode opposed quirk mode addition html provides transitional frameset dtds explained the transitional type inclusive incorporating current tag well older deprecated tag strict dtd excluding deprecated tag the frameset tag necessary make frame page along tag included transitional type semantic html way writing html emphasizes meaning encoded information presentation look html included semantic markup inception also included presentational markup font center tag there also semantically neutral div span tag since late cascading style sheet beginning work browser

presentational markup tag deprecated current html xhtml recommendation the majority presentational feature previous version html longer allowed lead poorer accessibility higher cost site maintenance larger document size good semantic html also improves accessibility web document see also web content accessibility guideline for example screen reader audio browser correctly ascertain structure

modern browser mime type sent html document may affect document initially interpreted document sent xhtml mime type expected well-formed xml syntax error may cause browser fail render the document sent html mime type might displayed successfully since browser lenient html the recommendation state xhtml document follow guideline set forth recommendation appendix may labeled either mime type

the latest standard surrounding html reflect effort overcome sometimes chaotic development language create rational foundation building meaningful well-presented document return html role semantic language developed style language cs xsl shoulder burden presentation conjunction html specification slowly reined presentational element there two ax differentiating various variation html currently specified sgml-based html versus xml-based html referred xhtml one axis strict versus transitional loose versus frameset axis one difference latest html specification lie distinction sgml-based specification xml-based specification the xml-based specification usually called xhtml distinguish clearly traditional definition however root element name continues html even xhtml-specified html the intended xhtml identical html except limitation xml complex sgml require workarounds because xhtml html closely related sometimes documented parallel circumstance author conflate two name html html like html xhtml three sub-specifications strict transitional frameset aside different opening declaration document difference html xhtml document—in corresponding dtds—are largely syntactic the underlying syntax html allows many shortcut xhtml element optional opening closing tag even empty element must end tag contrast xhtml requires element opening tag closing tag xhtml however also introduces new shortcut xhtml tag may opened closed within tag including slash end tag like br/ the introduction shorthand used sgml declaration html may confuse earlier software unfamiliar new convention fix include space closing tag understand subtle difference html xhtml consider transformation valid well-formed xhtml document adheres appendix see valid html document making translation

version intended new document considered best practice transitional frameset version developed make easier transition document conformed older html specification n't conform specification version html the transitional frameset version allow presentational markup omitted strict version instead cascading style sheet encouraged improve presentation html document because xhtml defines xml syntax language defined html difference apply xhtml well the transitional version allows following part vocabulary included strict version the frameset version includes everything transitional version well frameset element used instead body frame element addition transitional difference frameset specification whether xhtml html specify different content model frameset replacing body contains either frame element optionally noframes body list demonstrates loose version specification maintained legacy support however contrary popular misconception move xhtml imply removal legacy support rather xml stand extensible modularizing entire specification open independent extension the primary achievement move xhtml xhtml modularization entire specification the strict version html deployed xhtml set modular extension base xhtml specification likewise someone looking loose transitional frameset specification find similar extended xhtml support much contained legacy frame module modularization also allows separate feature develop timetable example xhtml allow quicker migration emerging xml standard mathml presentational semantic math language based xml xforms—a new highly advanced web-form technology replace existing html form summary html specification primarily reined various html implementation single clearly written specification based sgml xhtml ported specification new xml-defined
