logic true/false decision problem decidable exists effective method deriving correct answer zeroth-order logic propositional logic decidable whereas first-order higher-order logic logical system decidable membership set logically valid formula theorem effectively determined theory set sentence closed logical consequence fixed logical system decidable effective method determining whether arbitrary formula included theory many important problem undecidable proven effective method determining membership returning correct answer finite though possibly long time case exist each logical system come syntactic component among thing determines notion provability semantic component determines notion logical validity the logically valid formula system sometimes called theorem system especially context first-order logic gödel completeness theorem establishes equivalence semantic syntactic consequence setting linear logic syntactic consequence provability relation may used define theorem system logical system decidable effective method determining whether arbitrary formula theorem logical system for example propositional logic decidable truth-table method used determine whether arbitrary propositional formula logically valid first-order logic decidable general particular set logical validity signature includes equality least one predicate two argument decidable logical system extending first-order logic second-order logic type theory also undecidable the validity monadic predicate calculus identity decidable however this system first-order logic restricted signature function symbol whose relation symbol equality never take one argument some logical system adequately represented set theorem alone for example kleene logic theorem case alternative definition decidability logical system often used ask effective method determining something general validity formula instance validity sequents consequence relation logic theory set formula often assumed closed logical consequence decidability theory concern whether effective procedure decides whether formula member theory given arbitrary formula signature theory the problem decidability arises naturally theory defined set logical consequence fixed set axiom there several basic result decidability theory every non-paraconsistent inconsistent theory decidable every formula signature theory logical consequence thus member theory every complete recursively enumerable first-order theory decidable extension decidable theory may decidable for example undecidable theory propositional logic although set validity smallest theory decidable consistent theory property every consistent extension undecidable said essentially undecidable fact every consistent extension essentially undecidable the theory field undecidable essentially undecidable robinson arithmetic known essentially undecidable thus every consistent theory includes interprets robinson arithmetic also essentially undecidable example decidable first-order theory include theory real closed field presburger arithmetic theory group robinson arithmetic example undecidable theory some decidable theory include monk method used establish decidability include quantifier elimination model completeness łoś-vaught test some undecidable theory include monk the interpretability method often used establish undecidability theory essentially undecidable theory interpretable consistent theory also essentially undecidable this closely related concept many-one reduction computability theory property theory logical system weaker decidability semidecidability theory semidecidable effective method given arbitrary formula always tell correctly formula theory may give either negative answer answer formula theory logical system semidecidable effective method generating theorem theorem every theorem eventually generated this different decidability semidecidable system may effective procedure checking formula theorem every decidable theory logical system semidecidable general converse true theory decidable complement semi-decidable for example set logical validity first-order logic semi-decidable decidable case effective method determining arbitrary formula whether similarly set logical consequence recursively enumerable set first-order axiom semidecidable many example undecidable first-order theory given form decidability confused completeness for example theory algebraically closed field decidable incomplete whereas set true first-order statement nonnegative integer language complete undecidable unfortunately terminological ambiguity term undecidable statement sometimes used synonym independent statement concept decidable set definition decidable theory logical system given either
