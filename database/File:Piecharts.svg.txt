Original file ‎(SVG file, nominally 689 × 494 pixels, file size: 39 KB) Example of a pie chart, along with a bar plot showing the same data and indicating that the pie chart is not the best possible chart for this particular dataset. The graphic was created by User:Schutz for Wikipedia on 28 August 2007 using the R statistical project. The program that generated the graphic is given below. The graph was exported in postscript format, converted to SVG using the pstoedit command, and the layout was slightly modified using Inkscape before upload.
