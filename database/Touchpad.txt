touchpad trackpad pointing device featuring tactile sensor specialized surface translate motion position user finger relative position operating system made output screen touchpads common feature laptop computer opposed using mouse desktop also used substitute mouse desk space scarce because vary size also found personal digital assistant pda portable medium player wireless touchpads also available detached accessory touchpads operate one several way including capacitive sensing resistive touchscreen the common technology used sens change capacitance finger touch pad capacitance-based touchpads sense tip pencil similar ungrounded non-conducting implement finger insulated glove may also problematic capacitive touchpads rarely used pointing device medical hardware while touchpads like touchscreen able sense absolute position resolution limited size for common use pointer device dragging motion finger translated finer relative motion cursor output display operating system analogous handling mouse lifted put back surface hardware button equivalent standard mouse left right button sometimes positioned adjacent touchpad some touchpads associated device driver software may interpret tapping pad mouse click tap followed continuous pointing motion click-and-a-half indicate dragging tactile touchpads allow clicking dragging incorporating button functionality surface touchpad select one press touchpad instead physical button drag instead performing click-and-a-half technique user press object drag without releasing pressure let done touchpad driver also allow use multiple finger emulate mouse button commonly two-finger tapping center button touchpads called clickpads physical button instead relies software button physically whole clickpad formed button logically driver interprets click left right button click depending placement finger some touchpads hotspot location touchpad used functionality beyond mouse for example certain touchpads moving finger along edge touch pad act scroll wheel controlling scrollbar scrolling window focus vertically horizontally many touchpads use two-finger dragging scrolling also touchpad driver support tap zone region tap execute function example pausing medium player launching application all function implemented touchpad device driver software disabled apollo desktop computer equipped touchpad right side keyboard introduced year later first battery powered clamshell laptop gavilan included touchpad mounted keyboard rather became norm psion series introduced came new mouse-replacing input device similar touchpad although closely resembling graphic tablet cursor positioned clicking specific point pad instead moving direction stroke laptop touchpads launched olivetti triumph-adler cirque introduced first widely available touchpad branded glidepoint apple introduced touchpads modern placing powerbook series using cirque glidepoint technology apple refers trackpad replaced trackball previous powerbook model since apple revision macbook macbook pro incorporated tactile touchpad design button integrated tracking surface lower part touchpad surface act clickable button another early adopter glidepoint pointing device sharp later synaptics introduced touchpad marketplace branded touchpad epson early adopter product actionnote touchpads began introduced laptop often confusion product called consistent term used reference varied glidepoint touch sensitive input device touchpad trackpad pointing device user often presented option purchase pointing stick touchpad trackball combination device common though touchpads trackball rarely included together since early touchpads become dominant laptop pointing device consumer laptop produced period beyond includes touchpads displacing pointing stick touchpads primarily used self-contained portable laptop computer require flat surface near machine the touchpad close keyboard relatively short finger movement required move cursor across display screen advantageous also make possible user palm wrist move mouse cursor accidentally typing laptop today feature multitouch touchpads sense case five finger simultaneously providing option input ability bring context menu tapping two finger dragging two finger scrolling gesture zoom in/out rotate the touchpads physical button hi-end business\professional laptop option
