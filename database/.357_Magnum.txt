the smith wesson magnum magnum magnum known unofficial metric designation smokeless powder cartridge bullet diameter created elmer keith phillip sharpe douglas wesson firearm manufacturer smith wesson winchester the magnum cartridge notable highly effective terminal ballistics the magnum cartridge based upon smith wesson earlier special cartridge introduced use since become widespread this cartridge began magnum era handgun ammunition the magnum era began rifle cartridge spreading handgun magnum the magnum collaboratively developed period early group individual direct response colt super automatic time super american pistol cartridge capable defeating automobile cover early ballistic vest beginning emerge interwar period test time revealed vest defeated handgun bullet traveling le foot per second m/s colt super automatic edged velocity able penetrate car door vest bootlegger gangster employing cover though special magnum would seem different diameter chamberings fact identical inch bullet diameter the special nomenclature relates previous use heeled bullet short colt long colt diameter case the external dimensional difference special magnum difference case length done prevent accidentally loading magnum cartridge special revolver designed magnum higher chamber pressure case volume factor increase case length special cartridge originally black powder cartridge magnum developed using much denser smokeless powder much credit early development given hunter experimenter elmer keith keith early work loading special increasingly higher-pressure level made possible availability heavy target-shooting-oriented revolver like smith wesson heavy duty outdoorsman revolver built frame the load used cartridge loaded much higher velocity standard ammunition the revolver made using special size gun barrel bored accept bullet true bullet diameter special cylinder bored accept cartridge name special originated since frame cylinder barrel much stronger standard special component capable withstanding much higher pressure the round longer available case equal later magnum work double pressure standard special the magnum address safety issue earlier cartridge lengthening cartridge approximately inch preventing high-pressure cartridge chambering fitting firearm designed shorter lower-pressure special elmer keith also contributed keith-style bullet increased mass bullet located outside cartridge case leaving room inside case powder the keith bullet also employed large flat meplat thus enabling rapid energy transfer greater wounding property time bullet design deform like hollow point result achieves greater penetration these characteristic keith bullet make suitable hunting application well target shooting reassert leading law-enforcement armament provider smith wesson developed magnum douglas wesson grandson co-founder daniel wesson leading effort within smith wesson along considerable technical assistance phillip sharpe member technical division staff national rifle association america the new round developed smith wesson existing special round used different powder load ultimately case extended inch the case extension matter safety necessity because special early experimental magnum cartridge loaded keith identical physical attribute possible load experimental magnum cartridge special revolver potentially disastrous result smith wesson solution extending case slightly made impossible chamber magnum-power round gun designed additional pressure however although special magnum chamber colt new army revolver long colt due straight-walled chamber creates dangerous pressure level three time new army designed withstand the choice bullet magnum cartridge varied development during development smith wesson original keith bullet modified slightly form sharpe bullet based upon keith bullet bearing surface keith bullet keith bullet typically made oversized sized winchester however upon experimenting cartridge development modified sharpe-bullet shape slightly keeping sharpe contour bullet the final choice bullet hence based upon earlier keith sharpe bullet additionally slight difference the magnum milliliter grain

c.i.p.-regulated country currently proof tested mpa psi piezo pressure this cartridge regarded many excellent hunting metallic silhouette self-defense round citation needed with proper loading also effective large dangerous game bear ungulate citation needed however many consider larger powerful magnum cartridge appropriate magnum magnum casull magnum ruger magnum original research comparatively magnum le energy larger magnum revolver loading smaller diameter high velocity allowing excellent penetration property fine small- medium-game round sufficient hunt deer reasonable range suitable loading used competent marksman for comparison magnum higher velocity yard parent case special muzzle the magnum effectiveness game similar colt much flatter trajectory due higher velocity used success self-defence plinking hunting target shooting better source needed the original load grain bullet advertised muzzle velocity fps muzzle velocity taken using revolver fairly long barrel most today load fairly mild compared original load revolver chambered magnum significant advantage also able chamber fire shorter less-powerful special cartridge compared magnum special also lower cost recoil noise muzzle flash the ability also fire special make revolver ideal novice shooter yet used firing full-power magnum load want expense buying second lower-powered gun train however special ammunition generally used magnum semiautomatic handgun rifle since firearm require larger recoil produced firing magnum round cycle properly also become popular dual-use cartridge short light rifle like american old west lever-actions rifle bullet exit barrel foot per second m/s making far versatile carbine winchester found effective steel car door ballistic vest metal-penetrating round popular united state among highway patrol police organization the magnum revolver largely replaced modern high-capacity semi-automatic pistol police use still popular backup gun use among outdoorsman security guard civilian hunting metallic silhouette target shooting self-defense the winchester magnum also known developed duplicate performance magnum semi-automatic pistol sig cartridge some common performance parameter shown table several magnum load bullet weight ranging grain common the grain jacketed hollow point load popular self-defence whereas heavier load commonly used hunting citation

benchmark special wadcutter roundâ€”indeed good magnum revolver shoot special wadcutter ammunition good result accuracy power versatility also capable using less-expensive milder special ammunition make magnum revolver excellent gun many different discipline precision shooting long-range falling-plate event excellent round considering handloading ammunition economical consistently performs well the magnum developed earlier special this possible special introduced originally designed use black powder requires two-to-five time much powder volume produce velocity bullet much efficient smokeless powder thus special relatively large case capacity lower pressure mpa psi pmax piezo pressure the parabellum introduced originally designed use smokeless powder higher pressure mpa psi pmax piezo pressure therefore produce considerably energy despite case le half powder capacity many special load use powder similar charge weight case much larger light-target load fast-burning powder may fill case perhaps full filling case slower-burning powder produce much power also much pressure far much pressure older smaller-frame revolver chambered special accommodate high-pressure high-power load longer magnum together stronger revolver designed handle developed the sig developed named highlight intended purpose duplicate performance magnum load fired revolver cartridge designed used
