digital object identifier doi persistent identifier handle used uniquely identify various object standardized international organization standardization iso doi implementation handle system also fit

handle take form character string divided two part prefix suffix separated slash the prefix identifies registrant identifier suffix chosen registrant identifies specific object associated doi most legal unicode character allowed string interpreted case-insensitive manner the prefix usually take form nnnn least four digit number greater equal whose limit depends total number registrant the

display screen print format contrary doi handbook crossref major doi registration agency recommends displaying url example http instead officially specified format example this url persistent contract ensures persistence doi.org domain purl providing location http proxy server redirect web access correct online location linked item the crossref recommendation primarily based assumption doi displayed without hyperlinked appropriate url argument without hyperlink easy copy-and-paste full url actually bring page doi thus entire url displayed allowing people viewing page containing doi copy-and-paste url hand new window/tab browser order appropriate page document doi represents since doi namespace within handle system semantically correct represent uri info major content doi system currently includes organisation economic co-operation development publication service oecd ilibrary table graph oecd publication shown doi name lead excel file data underlying table graph further development service planned other registry include crossref multilingual european doi registration agency medra since rfcs referenced .... the idf designed doi system provide form persistent identification doi name permanently unambiguously identifies object associated although publisher journal change sometimes doi changed old doi longer working also associate metadata object allowing provide user relevant piece information object relationship included part metadata network action allow doi name resolved web location object describe found achieve goal doi system combine handle system indecs content model social infrastructure the handle system ensures doi name object based changeable attribute object physical location ownership attribute object encoded metadata rather doi name two object assigned doi name because doi name short character string human-readable may copied pasted text fit uri specification the doi name-resolution mechanism act behind scene user communicate way web service built open architecture incorporates trust mechanism engineered operate reliably flexibly adapted changing demand new application doi system doi name-resolution may used openurl select appropriate among multiple location given object according location user making request however despite ability doi system drawn criticism librarian directing user non-free copy

relevant data may public restricted registrant may update metadata doi name time publication information change object move different url the international doi foundation idf oversees integration technology operation system technical social infrastructure the social infrastructure federation independent registration agency offering doi service modelled existing successful federated deployment identifier isbn doi name differs commonly used internet pointer material uniform resource locator url identifies object first-class entity rather specific place object located certain time implement uniform resource identifier uniform resource name concept add data model social infrastructure doi name also differs standard identifier registry isbn isrc etc the purpose identifier registry manage given collection identifier whereas primary purpose doi system make collection identifier actionable interoperable collection include identifier many controlled collection the doi system offer persistent semantically interoperable resolution related current data best suited material used service outside direct control issuing assigner e.g. public citation managing content value us managed registry providing social technical infrastructure assume specific business model provision identifier service enables existing service link defined way several approach making identifier persistent proposed the comparison persistent identifier approach difficult thing imprecisely referring set scheme identifier n't mean compared easily other identifier system may enabling technology low barrier entry providing easy use labeling mechanism allows anyone set new instance example include persistent uniform resource locator purl url globally unique identifier guids etc may lack functionality registry-controlled scheme usually lack accompanying metadata controlled scheme the doi system approach compared directly identifier scheme various application using enabling technology added feature devised meet feature offered doi system specific sector e.g. ark doi name depend object location way similar uniform resource name urn purl differs ordinary url url often used substitute identifier document internet although document two different location two url contrast persistent identifier doi name identify object first class entity two instance object would doi name doi name resolution provided handle system developed corporation national research initiative freely available user encountering doi name resolution redirects user doi name one piece typed data url representing instance object service e-mail one item metadata handle system doi name handle set value assigned may thought record consists group field each handle value must data type specified type field defines syntax semantics data while doi persistently uniquely identifies object assigned doi resolution may persistent due technical administrative issue resolve doi name may input doi resolver doi.org another approach avoids typing cutting-and-pasting resolver include doi document url us resolver http proxy http //doi.org/ preferred http //dx.doi.org/ support http for example doi included reference hyperlink http this approach allows user click doi normal hyperlink indeed previously mentioned crossref recommends doi always represented preferring http http cut-and-pasted document email etc. actionable other doi resolvers http proxy include handle system pangaea beginning year new class alternative doi resolvers started http //doai.io this service unusual try find non-paywalled often author archived version title redirects user instead publisher version since open-access favoring doi resolvers created notably http //oadoi.org/ october later unpaywall while traditional doi resolvers solely rely handle system alternative doi resolvers first consult open access resource base bielefeld academic search engine alternative http proxy use one number add-on plug-in browser thereby avoiding conversion doi url depend domain name may subject change still allowing doi treated normal hyperlink for example cnri handle extension firefox enables browser access handle system handle doi like directly firefox browser using native handle system protocol this plug-in also replace reference web-to-handle proxy server native resolution disadvantage approach publisher least
