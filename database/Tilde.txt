tilde represents negation mean proposition modern use often replaces tilde negation symbol purpose avoid confusion equivalence relation mathematics tilde operator unicode sometimes called twiddle often used denote equivalence relation two object thus mean equivalent weaker statement stating equal the expression sometimes read aloud twiddle perhaps analogue verbal expression the tilde indicate approximate equality variety way used denote asymptotic equality two function for example mean lim \displaystyle \lim x\to \infty \frac tilde also used indicate approximately equal e.g this usage
