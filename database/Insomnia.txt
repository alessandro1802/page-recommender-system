insomnia also known sleeplessness sleep disorder people trouble sleeping they may difficulty falling asleep staying asleep long desired insomnia typically followed daytime sleepiness low energy irritability depressed mood may result increased risk motor vehicle collision well problem focusing learning insomnia short term lasting day week long term lasting month the concept word insomnia two possibility insomnia disorder insomnia symptom many abstract randomized controlled trial systematic review often underreport two possibility word insomnia refers insomnia occur independently result another problem condition result insomnia include psychological stress chronic pain heart failure hyperthyroidism heartburn restless leg syndrome menopause certain medication drug caffeine nicotine alcohol other risk factor include working night shift sleep apnea diagnosis based sleep habit examination look underlying cause sleep study may done look underlying sleep disorder screening may done two question experience difficulty sleeping difficulty falling staying asleep although efficacy first line treatment unequivocally established sleep hygiene lifestyle change typically first treatment insomnia sleep hygiene includes consistent bedtime quiet dark room exposure sunlight day regular exercise cognitive behavioral therapy may added while sleeping pill may help sometimes associated injury dementia addiction these medication recommended four five week the effectiveness safety alternative medicine unclear between adult insomnia given point time half people insomnia given year about people insomnia due another problem last month people age affected often younger people female often affected male description insomnia occur least far back ancient greece symptom insomnia sleep onset insomnia difficulty falling asleep beginning night often symptom anxiety disorder delayed sleep phase disorder misdiagnosed insomnia sleep onset delayed much later normal awakening spill daylight hour common patient difficulty falling asleep also nocturnal awakening difficulty returning sleep two-thirds patient wake middle night half trouble falling back sleep middle-of-the-night awakening early morning awakening awakening occurring earlier minute desired inability back sleep total sleep time reach hour early morning awakening often characteristic depression anxiety symptom may well lead insomnia some symptom include tension compulsive worrying future feeling overstimulated overanalyzing past event poor sleep quality occur result example restless leg sleep apnea major depression poor sleep quality defined individual reaching stage delta sleep restorative property major depression lead alteration function hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis causing excessive release cortisol lead poor sleep quality nocturnal polyuria excessive nighttime urination also result poor quality sleep some case insomnia really insomnia traditional sense people experiencing sleep state misperception often sleep normal amount time the problem despite sleeping multiple hour night typically experiencing significant daytime sleepiness symptom sleep loss feel like slept much because perception sleep incomplete incorrectly believe take abnormally long time fall asleep underestimate long remain asleep symptom insomnia caused associated sleep study using polysomnography suggested people sleep disruption elevated nighttime level circulating cortisol adrenocorticotropic hormone they also elevated metabolic rate occur people insomnia whose sleep intentionally disrupted sleep study study brain metabolism using positron emission tomography pet scan indicate people insomnia higher metabolic rate night day the question remains whether change cause consequence long-term insomnia heritability estimate insomnia vary male female genome-wide association study gwas identified genomic locus gene influence risk insomnia showed insomnia highly polygenic particular strong positive association observed gene male female this study showed genetic architecture insomnia strongly overlap psychiatric disorder metabolic trait hypothesised epigenetics might also influence insomnia controlling process sleep regulation brain-stress response impact well brain plasticity alcohol often used form self-treatment insomnia induce sleep however alcohol use induce sleep cause insomnia long-term use alcohol associated decrease nrem stage sleep well suppression rem sleep rem sleep fragmentation frequent moving sleep stage occurs awakening due headache need urinate dehydration excessive sweating glutamine rebound also play role someone drinking alcohol inhibits glutamine one body natural stimulant when person stop drinking body try make lost time producing glutamine need the increase glutamine level stimulates brain drinker trying sleep keeping him/her reaching deepest level sleep stopping chronic alcohol use also lead severe insomnia vivid dream during withdrawal rem sleep typically exaggerated part rebound effect like alcohol benzodiazepine alprazolam clonazepam lorazepam diazepam commonly used treat insomnia short-term prescribed self-medicated worsen sleep long-term while benzodiazepine put people sleep i.e. inhibit nrem stage sleep asleep drug disrupt sleep architecture decreasing sleep time delaying time rem sleep decreasing deep slow-wave sleep restorative part sleep energy mood opioid medication hydrocodone oxycodone morphine used insomnia associated pain due analgesic property hypnotic effect opioids fragment sleep decrease rem stage sleep producing analgesia sedation opioids may appropriate carefully selected patient pain-associated insomnia however dependence opioids lead long-term sleep disturbance insomnia affect people age group people following group higher chance acquiring insomnia two main model exists mechanism insomnia cognitive physiological the cognitive model suggests rumination hyperarousal contribute preventing person falling asleep might lead episode insomnia the physiological model based upon three major finding people insomnia firstly increased urinary cortisol catecholamine found suggesting increased activity hpa axis arousal second increased global cerebral glucose utilization wakefulness nrem sleep people insomnia lastly increased full body metabolism heart rate insomnia all finding taken together suggest dysregulation arousal system cognitive system hpa axis contributing insomnia however unknown hyperarousal result cause insomnia altered level inhibitory neurotransmitter gaba found result inconsistent implication altered level ubiquitous neurotransmitter unknown study whether insomnia driven circadian control sleep wake dependent process shown inconsistent result literature suggests dysregulation circadian rhythm based core temperature increased beta activity decreased delta wave activity observed electroencephalogram however implication unknown around half post-menopausal woman experience sleep disturbance generally sleep disturbance twice common woman men appears due part completely change hormone level especially post-menopause change sex hormone men woman age may account part increased prevalence sleep disorder older people medicine insomnia widely measured using athens insomnia scale measured using eight different parameter related sleep finally represented overall scale ass individual sleep pattern qualified sleep specialist consulted diagnosis sleep disorder appropriate measure taken past medical history physical examination need done eliminate condition could cause insomnia after condition ruled comprehensive sleep history taken the sleep history include sleep habit medication prescription non-prescription alcohol consumption nicotine caffeine intake co-morbid illness sleep environment sleep diary used keep track individual sleep pattern the diary include time bed total sleep time time sleep onset number awakening use medication time awakening subjective feeling morning the sleep diary replaced validated use out-patient actigraphy week using non-invasive device measure movement worker complain insomnia routinely polysomnography screen sleep disorder this test may indicated patient symptom addition insomnia including sleep apnea obesity thick neck diameter high-risk fullness flesh oropharynx usually test needed make diagnosis insomnia especially working people often treated changing job schedule make time sufficient sleep improving sleep hygiene some patient may need overnight sleep study determine insomnia present such study commonly involve assessment tool including polysomnogram multiple sleep latency test specialist sleep medicine qualified diagnose disorder within according icsd major sleep disorder diagnostic category patient disorder including delayed sleep phase disorder often mis-diagnosed primary insomnia person trouble getting sleep awakening desired time normal sleep pattern asleep circadian rhythm disorder likely cause many case insomnia co-morbid another disease side-effects medication psychological problem approximately half diagnosed insomnia related psychiatric disorder for depression insomnia regarded co-morbid condition rather secondary one insomnia typically predates psychiatric symptom fact possible insomnia represents significant risk development subsequent psychiatric disorder insomnia occurs people depression this may partly due treatment used depression determination causation necessary diagnosis the criterion insomnia include following predominant complaint dissatisfaction sleep quantity quality associated one following symptom addition insomnia classified transient acute chronic prevention treatment insomnia may require combination cognitive behavioral therapy medication lifestyle change among lifestyle practice going sleep waking time day create steady pattern may help prevent insomnia avoidance vigorous exercise caffeinated drink hour going sleep recommended exercise earlier day may beneficial other practice improve sleep hygiene may include recommended rule medical psychological cause deciding treatment insomnia cognitive behavioral therapy generally first line treatment done found effective chronic insomnia the beneficial effect contrast produced medication may last well beyond stopping therapy medication used mainly reduce symptom insomnia short duration role management chronic insomnia remains unclear several different type medication may used many doctor recommend relying prescription sleeping pill long-term use also important identify treat medical condition may contributing insomnia depression breathing problem chronic pain many people insomnia reported receiving overall sufficient sleep treatment insomnia non-medication based strategy comparable efficacy hypnotic medication insomnia may longer lasting effect hypnotic medication recommended short-term use dependence rebound withdrawal effect upon discontinuation tolerance develop non medication based strategy provide long lasting improvement insomnia recommended first line long-term strategy management behavioral sleep medicine bsm try address insomnia non-pharmacological treatment the bsm strategy used address chronic insomnia include attention sleep hygiene stimulus control behavioral intervention sleep-restriction therapy paradoxical intention patient education relaxation therapy some example keeping journal restricting time spent awake bed practicing relaxation technique maintaining regular sleep schedule wake-up time behavioral therapy assist patient developing new sleep behavior improve sleep quality consolidation behavioral therapy may include learning healthy sleep habit promote sleep relaxation undergoing light therapy help worry-reduction strategy regulating circadian clock music may improve insomnia adult see music sleep eeg biofeedback demonstrated effectiveness treatment insomnia improvement duration well quality sleep self-help therapy defined psychological therapy worked one may improve sleep quality adult insomnia small moderate degree stimulus control therapy treatment patient conditioned associate bed sleep general negative response stimulus control therapy involves taking step control sleep environment sometimes referred interchangeably concept sleep hygiene example environmental modification include using bed sleep sex activity reading watching television waking time every morning including weekend going bed sleepy high likelihood sleep occur leaving bed beginning activity another location sleep occur reasonably brief period time getting bed commonly min reducing subjective effort energy expended trying fall asleep avoiding exposure bright light nighttime hour eliminating daytime nap component stimulus control therapy sleep restriction technique aim match time spent bed actual time spent asleep this technique involves maintaining strict sleep-wake schedule sleeping certain time day specific amount time induce mild sleep deprivation complete treatment usually last week involves making oneself sleep minimum amount time actually capable average capable i.e sleep efficiency improves slowly increasing amount min going bed earlier body attempt reset internal sleep clock bright light therapy may effective insomnia paradoxical intention cognitive reframing technique insomniac instead attempting fall asleep night make every effort stay awake i.e essentially stop trying fall asleep one theory may explain effectiveness method voluntarily making oneself sleep relief performance anxiety arises need requirement fall asleep meant passive act this technique shown reduce sleep effort performance anxiety also lower subjective assessment sleep-onset latency overestimation sleep deficit quality found many insomniac sleep hygiene common term behavior relate promotion good sleep they include habit provide good foundation sleep help prevent insomnia however sleep hygiene alone may adequate address chronic insomnia sleep hygiene recommendation typically included one component cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia cbt-i recommendation include reducing caffeine nicotine alcohol consumption maximizing regularity efficiency sleep episode minimizing medication usage daytime napping promotion regular exercise facilitation positive sleep environment the creation positive sleep environment may also helpful reducing symptom insomnia hand systematic review aasm concluded clinician prescribe sleep hygiene insomnia due evidence absence efficacy potential delaying adequate treatment recommending instead effective therapy cbt-i preferred there evidence cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia cbt-i superior long-term benzodiazepine nonbenzodiazepines treatment management insomnia therapy patient taught improved sleep habit relieved counter-productive assumption sleep common misconception expectation modified include numerous study reported positive outcome combining cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia treatment treatment stimulus control relaxation therapy hypnotic medication equally effective

insomnia the long lasting benefit course cbt-i show superiority pharmacological hypnotic drug even short term compared short-term hypnotic medication zolpidem cbt-i still show significant superiority thus cbt-i recommended first line treatment insomnia common form cbt-i treatment include stimulus control therapy sleep restriction sleep hygiene improved sleeping environment relaxation training paradoxical intention biofeedback cbt well-accepted form therapy insomnia since known adverse effect whereas taking medication alleviate insomnia symptom shown adverse side effect nevertheless downside cbt may take lot time motivation metacognition recent trend approach behaviour therapy insomnia despite therapeutic effectiveness proven success cbt treatment availability significantly limited lack trained clinician poor geographical distribution knowledgeable professional expense one way potentially overcome barrier use internet deliver treatment making effective intervention
