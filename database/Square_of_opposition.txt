term logic branch philosophical logic square opposition diagram representing relation four basic categorical proposition the origin square traced back aristotle tractate interpretation distinction two opposition contradiction contrariety however aristotle draw diagram this done several century later apuleius boethius traditional logic proposition latin propositio spoken assertion oratio enunciativa meaning assertion modern philosophy language logic categorical proposition simple proposition containing two term subject predicate predicate either asserted denied subject every categorical proposition reduced one four logical form named based latin affirmo affirm affirmative proposition nego deny negative proposition these tabular form proposition may stated all however proposition stated correspondingly all ambiguous either proposition thus requiring context determine form standard form unambiguous preferred proposition also take form sometimes certain literally latin 'quoddam nōn est \displaystyle modern form mean statement \displaystyle applies object \displaystyle may simply interpreted \displaystyle \displaystyle many case \displaystyle also written \displaystyle aristotle state chapter six seven peri hermēneias περὶ ἑρμηνείας latin interpretatione english 'on interpretation certain logical relationship four kind proposition say every affirmation corresponds exactly one negation every affirmation negation 'opposed always one must true false pair affirmative statement negation call 'contradiction medieval latin contradictio example contradictory 'every man white 'not every man white also read 'some men white 'no man white 'some man white the relation contrary subcontrary subalternation superalternation hold based traditional logic assumption thing stated thing satisfying statement modern logic exist assumption taken relation hold 'contrary medieval contrariae statement statement true time example universal affirmative 'every man white universal negative 'no man white these true time however contradictory may false for example false every man white since men white yet also false man white since white men since every statement contradictory opposite negation since contradictory true opposite false follows opposite contrary medievals called subcontraries subcontrariae true false since subcontraries negation universal statement called 'particular statement medieval logician another logical relation implied though mentioned explicitly aristotle 'alternation alternatio consisting 'subalternation 'superalternation subalternation relation particular statement universal statement quality affirmative negative particular implied universal superalternation relation falsity universal equivalently negation universal implied falsity particular equivalently negation particular the superalternation contrapositive subalternation relation particular subaltern universal particular superaltern for example 'every man white true contrary 'no man white false therefore contradictory 'some man white true similarly universal 'no man white implies particular 'not every man white summary these relationship became basis diagram originating boethius used medieval logician classify logical relationship the proposition placed four corner square relation represented line drawn whence name 'the square opposition therefore following case made memorize medievals invented following latin rhyme affirms neither true false case the applies while first two universal statement couple refers particular one the square opposition used categorical inference described greek philosopher aristotle conversion obversion contraposition each three type categorical inference applied four boethian logical form subcontraries medieval logician represented form 'quoddam est particular 'quoddam non est particular false since universal contradictory statement every true this lead difficulty firstly identified peter abelard april 'some seems imply 'something word exists something for example 'some man white seems imply least one thing exists man namely man white 'some man white true but 'some man white also implies something man exists namely man white statement 'some man white true but aristotelian logic requires one statement generally 'some particular 'some particular necessarily true i.e. false therefore since statement imply presence least one thing man presence man men followed but abelard point dialectica surely men might exist abelard also point subcontraries containing subject term denoting nothing man stone false terence parson born argues ancient philosopher experience problem existential import universal affirmative particular affirmative form existential import statement includes term statement false term instance i.e. thing associated term exists statement said existential import respect term go cite medieval philosopher william moerbeke and point boethius translation aristotle work giving rise mistaken notion form existential import century george boole november december argued requiring existential import term particular claim allowing term universal claim lack existential import this decision made venn diagram particularly easy use term logic the square opposition boolean set assumption often called modern square opposition modern square opposition claim contradictory form opposition cease hold contrary subcontraries subalternations superalternations thus modern point view often make sense talk 'the opposition claim rather insisting older logician claim several different opposite different kind opposition claim gottlob frege november july begriffsschrift also present square opposition organised almost identical manner classical square showing contradictory subalternates contrary four formula constructed universal quantification negation implication algirdas julien greimas march february semiotic square derived aristotle work the traditional square opposition often compared square based inner- outer-negation the square opposition extended logical hexagon includes relationship six statement discovered independently augustin sesmat april december robert blanché proven square
