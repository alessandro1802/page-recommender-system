balloon one first mechanism used air warfare their role originally mainly reconnaissance purpose they provided human first available method elevating well battlefield obtain proverbial birds-eye view they early instrument definitive intelligence collection also particularly useful preparation accurate battlefield map time rudimentary craft led many battlefield failure incendiary balloon also long history the incendiary balloon carry hot air something catch fire destroy enemy territory they also could hold small bomb combat kongming lantern used military signalling the lantern invented late han dynasty han dynasty chancellor zhuge liang kongming surrounded wei dynasty general sima pinlo sichuan zhuge liang used paper made lantern hot air balloon signal rescue force the kongming lantern become common military signal china inherited mongolian troop seen battle legnica flying kongming lantern civilian festival memorizing chancellor zhuge liang lantern festival the first successfully flown balloon made france montgolfier brother they rigid-style sphere made cotton silk stretched simple light wood frame resembling large egg these rigid balloon held fire smoke billowed well cavity sphere thought smoke made balloon rise actually hot air smoke caused elevating the first decisive use balloon aerial warfare performed french aerostatic corp using aerostat entreprenant the enterprising one battle fleurus the following year siege mainz observation balloon employed however french military use balloon continue uninterrupted napoleon disbanded french balloon corp napoleon considered invading england landing troop transported balloon consulted 'aeronaut official festival sophie blanchard whether invading england balloon viable she told invasion would likely succeed due
