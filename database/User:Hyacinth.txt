I'm a Wikipedian and I'm queer. I also have a currently uncontrolled seizure condition/epilepsy (but have been tonicâ€“clonic seizure, or "grand mal", free since 2016). What to do if a person has a seizure: I currently do have reasonable access to computers, but may take long breaks. If you have a question you may try my talk page or email. Reading Wikipedia, it seems like an amazingly grand resource, but editing Wikipedia is an amazingly negative experience. Wikipedia could be a bright warm place of joyous collaboration and the celebration of knowledge, and not a dark cold place of suffering and competition.
