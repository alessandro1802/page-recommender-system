mathematical logic term denotes mathematical object formula denotes mathematical fact particular term appear component formula this analogous natural language noun phrase refers object whole sentence refers fact first-order term recursively constructed constant symbol variable function symbol expression formed applying predicate symbol appropriate number term called atomic formula evaluates true false bivalent logic given interpretation for example \displaystyle term built constant variable binary function symbol \displaystyle \displaystyle part atomic formula \displaystyle \geq evaluates true real-numbered value besides logic term play important role universal algebra rewriting system given set variable symbol set constant symbol set n-ary function symbol also called operator symbol natural number set unsorted first-order term recursively defined smallest set following property using intuitive pseudo-grammatical notation sometimes written the signature term language describes function symbol set inhabited well-known example unary function symbol sin co binary function symbol ternary operation higher-arity function possible uncommon practice many author consider constant symbol function symbol thus needing special syntactic class term denotes mathematical object domain discourse constant denotes named object domain variable range object domain n-ary function map n-tuples object object for example variable symbol constant symbol add binary function symbol hence add first second third term building rule respectively the latter term usually written using infix notation common operator symbol convenience originally logician defined term character string adhering certain building rule however since concept tree became popular computer science turned convenient think term tree for example several distinct character string like \displaystyle \frac denote term correspond tree viz left tree picture separating tree structure term graphical representation paper also easy account parenthesis representation structure invisible multiplication operator existing structure representation two term said structurally literally syntactically equal correspond tree for example left right tree picture structurally unequal term although might considered semantically equal always evaluate value rational arithmetic while structural equality checked without knowledge meaning symbol semantic equality function e.g interpreted rational truncating integer division left right term evaluates respectively structural equal term need agree variable name contrast term called renaming variant term latter resulted consistently renaming variable former i.e renaming substitution case renaming since renaming substitution inverse both term also said equal modulo renaming many context particular variable name term n't matter e.g commutativity axiom addition stated x+y=y+x a+b=b+a case whole formula may renamed arbitrary subterm usually may e.g x+y=b+a valid version commutativity axiom note note the set variable term denoted var term n't contain variable called ground term term n't contain multiple occurrence variable called linear term for example ground term hence also linear term linear term non-linear term these property important example term rewriting given signature function symbol set term form free term algebra the set ground term form initial term algebra abbreviating number constant number i-ary function symbol number distinct ground term height computed following recursion formula given set n-ary relation symbol natural number unsorted first-order atomic formula obtained applying n-ary relation symbol term function symbol relation symbol set usually non-empty small mathematical logic complex formula built atomic formula using logical connective quantifier for example letting \displaystyle \mathbb denote set real number \displaystyle \mathbb mathematical formula evaluating true algebra complex number atomic formula called ground built entirely ground term ground atomic formula composable given set function predicate symbol make herbrand base symbol set when domain discourse contains element basically different kind useful split set term accordingly end sort sometimes also called type assigned variable constant symbol declaration note domain sort range sort function symbol sorted term ... may composed sorted subterms ... ith subterm sort match declared ith domain sort such term also called well-sorted term i.e obeying unsorted rule called ill-sorted for example vector space come associated field scalar number let denote sort vector number respectively let set vector number variable respectively set vector number constant respectively then e.g \displaystyle \vec \in vector addition scalar multiplication inner product declared \displaystyle w\times w\to w\times n\to \displaystyle \langle .\rangle w\times w\to respectively assuming variable symbol \displaystyle \vec \vec \in term \displaystyle \langle \vec \vec \vec b\rangle well-sorted \displaystyle \vec since n't accept term sort argument order make \displaystyle \vec well-sorted term additional declaration \displaystyle n\times w\to required function symbol several declaration called overloaded see many-sorted logic information including extension many-sorted framework described mathematical notation shown table fit scheme first-order term defined introduce local bound variable may appear outside notation scope e.g sin \displaystyle t\cdot \int \sin k\cdot n't make sense contrast variable referred free behave like ordinary first-order term variable e.g sin \displaystyle k\cdot \int \sin k\cdot make sense all operator viewed taking function rather value term one argument for example lim operator applied sequence i.e mapping positive integer e.g real number another example function implement second example table would function pointer argument see box lambda term used denote anonymous function supplied argument lim etc for example function square program written anonymously lambda term the general sum operator considered ternary function symbol taking lower bound value upper bound value function summed-up due latter argument operator called second-order function symbol another example lambda term x/n denotes function map ... ... respectively denotes sequence ... the lim operator take sequence return limit defined the rightmost column table indicates mathematical notation example represented lambda term also converting common infix operator prefix form
