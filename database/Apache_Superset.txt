Apache Superset is an open-source software application for data exploration and data visualization able to handle data at petabyte scale (big data). The application started as a hack-a-thon project by Maxime Beauchemin (creator of Apache Airflow) while working at Airbnb and entered the Apache Incubator program in 2017.[1] In addition to Airbnb, the project has seen significant contributions from other leading technology companies, including Lyft and Dropbox.[2] Superset graduated from the incubator program and became a top-level project at the Apache Software Foundation in 2021.[3] Maxime Beauchemin's company, Preset, offers Superset as a managed service (SaaS).[4]
