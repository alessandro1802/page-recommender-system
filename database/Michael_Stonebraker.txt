michael ralph stonebraker born october computer scientist specializing database system through series academic prototype commercial startup stonebraker research product central many relational database also founder many database company including ingres corporation illustra streambase system tamr vertica voltdb served chief technical officer informix for contribution database research stonebraker received turing award often described nobel prize computing stonebraker career broadly divided two phase time university california berkeley focused relational database management system ingres postgres massachusetts institute technology mit developed novel data management technique c-store h-store scidb stonebraker currently professor emeritus berkeley adjunct professor mit computer science artificial intelligence laboratory also known editor book reading database system stonebraker grew milton new hampshire earned b.s.e electrical engineering princeton university m.s ph.d. university michigan respectively his award include ieee john von neumann medal first sigmod edgar codd innovation award inducted fellow association computing machinery elected member national academy engineering development commercialization relational object-relational database system march announced acm turing award september commonwealth award chosen council member masstlc stonebraker joined university california berkeley assistant professor taught computer science department twenty-nine year early pioneering work relational database stonebraker colleague eugene wong started researching relational database system reading series seminal paper published edgar codd relational data model their project known ingres interactive graphic retrieval system one first system along system ibm demonstrate possible build practical efficient implementation relational model number key idea ingres still widely used relational system including use b-trees primary-copy replication query rewrite approach view integrity constraint idea rules/triggers integrity checking rdbms additionally much experimental work done provided insight build locking system could provide satisfactory transaction performance stonebraker team produced using rotating team student programmer usable relational database system time ingres considered low end compared ibm system ran unix-based digital equipment corporation machine opposed big iron ibm mainframe citation needed early however performance capability low-end machine seriously threatening ibm mainframe market threat came ability ingres become viable real product large number application ingres used variation bsd license nominal fee soon number company took advantage create commercial version ingres citation needed these included stonebraker fellow berkeley professor larry rowe eugene wong helped found relational technology inc. later called ingres corporation subsequently sold computer associate ingres re-established independent company later renamed actian other startup based ingres include sybase founded robert epstein student project britton lee inc. sybase code later used basis microsoft sql server after founding relational technology stonebraker rowe began post-ingres effort address limitation relational model the new project named postgres post ingres designed add support complex data type database system improve end-to-end performance data-intensive application postgres provided object relational programming model field could complex datatypes user could register new type well scalar aggregate function type postgres extensible number way making easy programmer modify add optimizer query language runtime indexing framework these feature improved database programmability performance made possible push large portion number application inside database including geographic information system time series processing this effect substantially broadening commercial database market postgres also offered using bsd-like license code form basis today free software postgresql stonebraker also led effort commercialize code creating illustra purchased informix postgresql used basis number startup company including aster data system enterprisedb greenplum informix acquired illustra stonebraker became informix cto position held september informix integrated illustra o–r mapping datablades online product resulting informix universal server ius generally version after postgres project stonebraker initiated mariposa project became basis cohera corporation mariposa built federated database economic model resource trading data distributed across multiple organization could integrated queried single relational interface governed site-specific policy would charge data processing storage these economic policy allowed traditional idea query optimization carried competing site also served basis data storage replication movement within federation cohera initial mission commercialize mariposa eventually focused business-to-business catalog management application core federated data integration engine cohera intellectual property purchased peoplesoft used basis peoplesoft enterprise catalog management peoplesoft turn purchased oracle corporation stonebraker became adjunct professor mit began another series research project founded number company aurora project stonebraker along colleague brandeis university brown university mit focused data management streaming data using new data model query language unlike relational system pull data process record time aurora data pushed arriving asynchronously external data source stock tick news feed sensor the output stream result windowed average sent user stonebraker co-founded streambase system commercialize technology behind aurora c-store project started stonebraker along colleague brandeis brown mit university massachusetts boston developed parallel shared-nothing column-oriented dbms data warehousing dividing storing data column c-store able perform le i/o get better compression ratio conventional database system store data row stonebraker explained similar data item side-by-side name name name name vs. name address zip phone stonebraker co-founded vertica commercialize technology behind c-store stonebraker started morpheus project along researcher university florida morpheus data integration system relies collection transforms mediate data source each transform provides queryable interface particular web site service morpheus make possible search compose multiple transforms provide new service unified view several service stonebraker co-founded goby local search company based idea morpheus people explore new thing free time researcher brown university mit yale university stonebraker started h-store project h-store distributed main-memory online transaction processing oltp system designed provide high throughput transaction processing workload stonebraker co-founded served adviser voltdb commercial startup based idea h-store project along david dewitt researcher brown mit portland state university slac university washington university wisconsin–madison stonebraker started scidb open-source dbms specially designed scientific research application founded marilyn matz became ceo developed scidb used mostly life science financial market novartis foundation medicine national institute health company client stonebraker criticized nosql movement stonebraker trained student including
