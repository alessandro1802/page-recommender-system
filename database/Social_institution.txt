self-enrichment transition democratic institution created simply transplanting institution new context happens interest dominant coalition widen access ian lustick suggests social science particularly institution central concept benefit applying concept natural selection study institution change time viewing institution existing within fitness landscape lustick argues gradual improvement typical many institution seen analogous hill-climbing within one fitness landscape this eventually lead institution becoming stuck local maximum institution improve would first need decrease overall fitness score e.g. adopt policy may cause short-term harm institution member the tendency get stuck local maximum explain certain type institution may continue policy harmful member institution even member leadership aware fault policy example lustick cite amyx analysis gradual rise japanese economy seemingly sudden reversal so-called lost decade according amyx japanese expert unaware possible cause japan economic decline rather return japan economy back path economic prosperity policymakers would adopt policy would first cause short-term harm japanese people government under analysis say ian lustick japan stuck local maximum arrived gradual increase fitness level set economic landscape without accompanying change institutional flexibility japan unable adapt changing condition even though expert may known change country needed would virtually powerless enact change without instituting unpopular policy would harmful short-term the lesson lustick analysis applied sweden economic situation similarly apply political gridlock often characterizes politics united state for example lustick observes politician hope run elected office stand little chance enact policy show short-term result unfortunately mismatch policy bring short-term benefit minimal sacrifice bring long-lasting change encouraging institution-level adaptation citation needed there criticism lustick application natural selection theory institutional change lustick note identifying inability institution adapt symptom stuck local maximum within fitness landscape nothing solve problem least however might add credibility idea truly beneficial change might require short-term harm institution member david sloan wilson note lustick need carefully distinguish two concept multilevel selection theory evolution multi-peaked landscape bradley thayer point concept fitness landscape local maximum make sense one institution said better another turn make sense insofar exists objective measure institution quality this may relatively simple evaluating economic prosperity society example difficult see objectively measure applied amount freedom society quality life individual within the term institutionalization widely used social theory refer process embedding something example concept social role particular value mode behavior within organization social system society whole the term may also used refer committing particular individual institution mental institution extent institutionalization may carry negative connotation regarding treatment damage caused vulnerable human being oppressive corrupt application inflexible system social medical legal control publicly owned private not-for-profit organization the term institutionalization may also used political sense apply creation organization
