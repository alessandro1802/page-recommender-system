julius wilhelm richard dedekind october february german mathematician made important contribution number theory abstract algebra particularly ring theory axiomatic foundation arithmetic his best known contribution definition real number notion dedekind cut also considered pioneer development modern set theory philosophy mathematics known logicism dedekind father julius levin ulrich dedekind administrator collegium carolinum braunschweig his mother caroline henriette dedekind née emperius daughter professor collegium richard dedekind three older sibling adult never used name julius wilhelm born braunschweig often called brunswick english lived life died first attended collegium carolinum transferring university göttingen there dedekind taught number theory professor moritz stern gauss still teaching although mostly elementary level dedekind became last student dedekind received doctorate thesis titled über die theorie der eulerschen integrale theory eulerian integral this thesis display talent evident dedekind subsequent publication time university berlin göttingen main facility mathematical research germany thus dedekind went berlin two year study bernhard riemann contemporary awarded habilitation dedekind returned göttingen teach privatdozent giving course probability geometry studied peter gustav lejeune dirichlet became good friend because lingering weakness mathematical knowledge studied elliptic abelian function yet also first göttingen lecture concerning galois theory about time became one first people understand importance notion group algebra arithmetic began teaching polytechnic school zürich eth zürich when collegium carolinum upgraded technische hochschule institute technology dedekind returned native braunschweig spent rest life teaching institute retired occasional teaching continued publish never married instead living sister julia dedekind elected academy berlin rome french academy science received honorary doctorate university oslo zurich braunschweig while teaching calculus first time polytechnic school dedekind developed notion known dedekind cut german schnitt standard definition real number the idea cut irrational number divide rational number two class set number one class greater strictly greater number lesser class for example square root defines nonnegative number whose square le negative number lesser class positive number whose square greater greater class every location number line continuum contains either rational irrational number thus empty location gap discontinuity dedekind published thought irrational number dedekind cut pamphlet stetigkeit und irrationale zahlen continuity irrational number modern terminology vollständigkeit completeness dedekind defined two set similar exists one-to-one correspondence invoked similarity give first citation needed precise definition infinite set set infinite similar proper part modern terminology equinumerous one proper subset thus set natural number shown similar subset whose member square every member dedekind work area anticipated georg cantor commonly considered founder set theory likewise contribution foundation mathematics anticipated later work major proponent logicism gottlob frege bertrand russell dedekind edited collected work lejeune dirichlet gauss riemann dedekind study lejeune dirichlet work led later study algebraic number field ideal published lejeune dirichlet lecture number theory vorlesungen über zahlentheorie lecture number theory written although book assuredly based dirichlet lecture although dedekind referred book throughout life dirichlet book entirely written dedekind part dirichlet death.the edition vorlesungen included supplement introducing notion ideal fundamental ring theory the word ring introduced later hilbert appear dedekind work dedekind defined ideal subset set number composed algebraic integer satisfy polynomial equation integer coefficient the concept underwent development hand hilbert especially emmy noether ideal generalize ernst eduard kummer ideal number devised part kummer attempt prove fermat last theorem thus dedekind said kummer important disciple article dedekind heinrich martin weber applied ideal riemann surface giving algebraic proof riemann–roch theorem published short monograph titled wa sind und sollen die zahlen what number good ewald included definition infinite set also proposed axiomatic foundation natural number whose primitive notion number one successor function the next year giuseppe peano citing dedekind formulated equivalent simpler set axiom standard one dedekind made contribution algebra for instance around wrote first paper modular lattice holiday interlaken dedekind met georg cantor thus began enduring relationship mutual respect dedekind became one first mathematician admire cantor work concerning infinite set proving valued ally cantor dispute leopold kronecker philosophically opposed cantor
